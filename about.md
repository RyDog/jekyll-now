In the Summer of 2014 I was living in a 250 sq. ft. studio in Bushwick, Brooklyn with my girlfriend, and my life did not feel like it was going in the right direction. After several years working as a corporate attorney and then 3 years working on a startup that didn't turn out the way I had hoped it would, I was completely burned out, broke and unemployed. In the 5 years that I had been living in New York City I had taken two vacations: a one week trip to Barbados and a one week trip to Mexico City. 

A couple of weeks after moving out of the expensive Williamsburg apartment I could no longer afford and into the much cheaper studio in Bushwick, I left my apartment one night and went out for a walk by myself. I walked to a local bar, drank a beer, maybe 2, and then started walking home. Two blocks from my apartment I heard someone running up behind me and turned around to see a young man swinging a heavy wooden cane at me. The cane connected hard with the top of my upper back and lower neck, and I fell forward and then turned myself around in a defensive fighting stance.  Unfortunately I was wearing flip flops, which I instinctively kicked off. 

Instead of charging me the man took a step back, which surprised me, but then I saw a group of 5 men emerge from behind a row of cars on the other side of the dark street and start running at me. I turned again and began to run barefoot down the middle of the street with 6 men chasing me in what I assumed was someone kind of gang initiation ritual. In my mind I was running for my life, and I'm sure that I had never in my life run that fast. The cane came flying by my head, hurled by my attacker, and then bounced across the asphalt in front of me. After 75 yards I emerged from that street and turned onto Myrtle Avenue, a main thoroughfare with an elevated train running above. As I ran down the middle of the street screaming for help the gang continued running after me.  Taxis and other cars passed me without stopping, and it was only after I ran into a well lighted gas station filled with taxis that the group broke up and decided to make their escape. I ran barefoot back to my apartment without even calling the police.  

My girlfriend was asleep, and I didn't want to wake her up and worry her.  Instead I sat in the low light thinking about my life, what had just happened to me, and what could have happened. I was over New York, and didn't want to live there any more. I thought about what I wanted to do with my life, and I realized that the only thing I really wanted to do was travel. That night I started searching for flights, and found a round trip from New York to Istanbul for $800 on Aeroflot, the Russian airline. Istanbul was a place that I had always wanted to visit, and it seemed as good as any place at that point. I didn't have enough cash for the trip, but I decided I would charge it on a credit card.   

In the morning I told my girlfriend what had happened, and then I told her that I really needed to take a trip by myself to try to figure some things out. She agreed it was a good idea, and four days later I landed in Istanbul. I had never written any stories before that trip, but for some reason I began to write down stories about my travels and post them on facebook for my friends and family to read. I receieved a lot of positive responses, which encouraged me to write and share more, and in the process my experience of travel changed and deepened.

When I returned to New York my girlfriend had moved out of our apartment and into the apartment of her new boyfriend. With 6 months remaining on my apartment's lease and newly single, I decided sublet the studio and leave New York. Within a few days I signed a sublease with a young couple from Europe, and the day before they moved in I packed everything in the apartment that I cared about into - or onto the top of - my beat up 1996 Subaru, drove out of New York City through a late summer rain storm.

Some of the words on this website were written on that trip to Turkey in the summer of 2014, but the rest were written after that drive out of New York in the Subaru, a trip that I'm still on. These stories represent my struggle to make sense of the journey that I am on, and the journies of other people I meet along the way.
