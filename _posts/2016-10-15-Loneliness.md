title: Don't You Get Lonely
---
Occasionally someone will ask me "Giovanni, don't you get lonely out there traveling by yourself?" I always take time to think about any question someone asks me, because new facts and information are always being uncovered by the light along the journey, so I run the question again. The last time someone asked me I said "I'm constantly lonely. But sometimes I feel more lonely around other people." And let me tell you something dear reader, that's all true. But one thing I do have in abundance is time to think, time to let my mind roam, which is a precious commodity. And sometimes I'll be driving along thinking about something sorta unconsciously and then, Bam!, I realize what I'm thinking about, scenarios that I'm going through-things like that- and I stop thinking about whatrver that was and start thinking "that is some weird/dark/fu*ked-up/nonsensical/counter-productive/and/or occasionally brilliant! shit you were just thinking about man! Take a drink of water and turn on some music, brother! Sometimes I'll go days without really talking to anyone about anything substantive and then ill find myself having a real conversation with another person and then Bam!, I realize that I am talking about these aforementioned "/ / / /" things and I'll recognize this look in this person's eye that's like "wow, this guy is out there." Then I usually try to like, ya know, reel it back in a lil bit...but, sometimes I can't help myself and I just step on the gas...!
