Office Politics:        

Two days ago the Chief Officer discovered that all of the six ballpoint pens located on the ship's bridge exhibited the marks of human teeth.  

These pens are "common" to the bridge and used by all of the deck officers to make logbook entries.  

A day before the Chief Officer's discovery, I discovered a pen bearing the logo of the Comfort Inn with a jagged edge where the top of the pen had been completely chewed off.  

I threw the pen into the waste basket, and thinking that it was surely an isolated incident and not a sign of a broader problem, thought no more of it.  

Until the beginning of my midnight watch yesterday, when I found a note the Chief Officer created lying on the chart table:

"If you are hungry please eat food - not pens -we all touch these & it's nasty!!!"

Attached to the note were 4 chewed pens.

Today, there was a second note:
"The Penible strikes again"

Attached to the note was a pen with the distinctive bite marks of the man now known as the "Penible." He apparently cannot control himself. This is compulsion, or worse. 

Everyone now knows that the Penible is the Third Officer, but he has denied responsibility.

When I asked the Third Officer if he was eating the bridge pens, he said, “No, why would I do that? I have my own pens,” and then darted off. Later, I wondered if he meant that he thought he was eating his own pens, or if he meant that he would not eat the bridge pens because he owned pens. I did not find either meaning satisfying. 

The Third Officer is a person who has already, through some gimmicks that would take much too long to explain, tried to cheat me out of five hundred, or perhaps as much as one thousand dollars. When I took the job in the union hall, the union rep said to me “Watch out for that third mate. Don’t trust that guy.” I thought nothing of it at the time. But now he is putting the bridge pens in his mouth and chewing on them, and apparently cannot control his behavior. 

The Chief Officer is not happy with the Penible, and as a result the stock of the Second Officer (my stock) has risen sharply. All I had to do was not chew on the bridge pens. He is also determined to put an end to the Penible’s behavior.

Today, in front of myself and the Penible, the Chief Officer gave the following warning: “This situation is ridiculous. I want you both to know that I took one of the bridge pens and I put it in my a**. I’m serious, I took one of the pens up here and I put it down my pants and I touched the top of it to my a** crack. So chew away.”

I am now carrying two of my own pens at all times. But I don’t have my own private Red pen yet. 

Surely the Chief Officer did not choose to soil the only red pen?
