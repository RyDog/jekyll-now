The abandoned Greek ghost-village of #Livissi is located on the Mediterranean coast in southwestern Turkey.

Livissi is the Greek name, and the Turks call it Kayaköy. 

Greeks had inhabited this region of Anatolia since at least 800 BC, but during the years 1914–22 (World War I and the Greco-Turkish War) much of the Greek population of the Ottoman Empire were expelled from Anatolia in an ethnic/religious cleansing that involved massacres, forced deportations, death marches, arbitrary execution, and general terror. 

It is estimated that several hundred thousand Ottoman Greeks were killed during this period. Many Greeks refer to this as the "Greek genocide."

Livissi is one of the towns abandoned by Ottoman Greeks during the cleansing.

In the aftermath of WWI the Greeks invaded Anatolia and also committed atrocities against Muslim Turks during a brutal conflict. Plenty of bitterness remains on both sides.

In 1923 Greece and Turkey signed a treaty agreeing to forced population exchanges. About 1.5 million Greeks from Anatolia and 500,000 Muslims from Greece were forcibly uprooted from their homelands, deported, and made refugees.

By the time of the treaty this village was already empty.
Today this village is a protected site and outdoor museum, but there is no information on site about what really happened to the people who once lived here. Several local people that I asked told me that the people left peacefully during the population exchange. That is not true, although that is what they have probably been taught in schools.

You can learn a lot about a nation and its people by understanding how they choose to deal with terrible and shameful parts of their history. Especially when they choose to deny or forget them.

Through the same analysis, you can learn a lot about your own country as well.
