title: Clinton Presidential Trailer Park

When an American president's time in power is coming to an end, he goes out and starts raising huge amounts of money from people seeking end-of-presidency or post-presidential influence. 
The money goes towards building an enormous monument to Himself. The monument is called a "Presidential Library."

In Little Rock, Arkansas William Jefferson Clinton built "monument to himself" along the banks of the Arkansas River. 
The admission price is $10.  Bill made sure to incorporate a top floor penthouse pad where he stays when in town. 

Below his penthouse, Bill built a 1:1 reproduction of the Oval Office, which is pretty damn cool. 
But, if you want a photo of yourself sitting at the desk in the office pretending like you're the president it will set you back $16.50. 
And no, you aren't allowed to take your own photos in Bill's fake Oval Office. 

Btw, anyone remember what Bill had going on in that chair? It led to a scandal... I sat in the chair. 
I closed my eyes and thought about all that.

Anyways, locals here in Little Rock say that it looks like an enormous mobile home, or "trailer home." 
They also joke that if Hillary becomes president she will build her monument beside her husband's, turning the monument into either a double-wide trailer, or a TRAILER PARK. Har Har! 

I'm more interested in what Trump's library might look like. 
I'm sure it will be larger and yuuger than all the others. Probably a skyscraper. Certainly a for-profit operation. 

Slot machines and a golf course would make sense.
