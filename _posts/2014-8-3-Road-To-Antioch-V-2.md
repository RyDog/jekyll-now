title: Road to Antioch, Part 2

Traveling is Glamorous.

The bus ticket from Goreme to Antioch was 55 Turkish lira; about $27.

I was not looking forward to this trip. It was over 100 degrees outside, and I had been sweating for 4 days. But it was a "dry heat." A cool 100.

4 liters of water a day and I would pee once. At least the stream was clear.

I was traveling with a small pack. Inside: Laptop, 4 pair of underwear, a pair of jeans, 3 shirts, 4 pair of socks, toothbrush/paste, bar of soap. All of the clothes were very dirty, and even tightly zipped the bag smelled exactly like a bag filled with very dirty clothes.

10 days in Turkey and I had done laundry once. I did not find the time in Goreme, and everything had been worn at least twice. The filthy shorts and very dirty shirt I was wearing were sticking to my wet skin.

After 10 days of sleeping in various cheap and uncomfortable beds, riding in buses, taking scooters off-road, hiking, walking, sightseeing, not exercising, eating poorly, and generally not taking great care of myself - I was aching.

A 9 hour bus ride was not on my list of things I wanted to do. But it was time to go.

A couple of hours before the bus arrived I sat down and wrote about the trip I would like to be taking. I had photographed a van the day before, and I imagined myself cruising through this amazing country in the van, listening to music, and relaxing. Just being on the road. Maybe writing about that trip was how I prepared myself for the real trip I was about to take. Maybe I wrote it for you.

The van trip wasn't my reality. Or maybe it was...
No doubt that it was my fantasy. 

We're all connected; all nodes on the network. We curate the parts of our lives that we want to present to the world, and then we share. Perfectly cropped and filtered Instagram pics...look how much fun I'm having! When you're traveling the urge is even greater. There’s pressure, real or imagined. Internal or external.

You dragged your ass all the way over there, and you better be having a great time. The greatest time. And if you can't quite convince yourself, at least you can convince other people. 

The same with our everyday lives: If you can’t convince yourself, hopefully you can convince someone else.

The bus ride was as uncomfortable as I anticipated. The bus aircon never allowed me to completely stop sweating, and I drank three liters of water on the ride.

I don't know what people are saying to me and they don't know what I'm saying to them.

Stopping at seedy bus stations, seemingly at random, to let people off, and take new passengers on. Having to pay to use every toilet. Outrage: It's not the money, it's the principle!

At Adana an old man gets on, sits next to me, and promptly falls asleep on my shoulder. I nudge him away, he makes a loud snorting noise, jolts forward, and then he's back on me. Repeat.

Look how much fun I'm having. I wish I could Instagram a picture of my dirty underwear right now and share it with the whole world.

On and on down the highway, into the night. Trying anything to find a comfortable position for 5 or 10 minutes. Sleep is impossible. 

Not a single tourist on the bus. Not a single tourist spotted at any bus stop along the 450km route. A sign.

Arrive in Antioch after midnight. Wandering around a strange city 12 miles from Syria at 1 am...good luck finding the place where you're going to stay. They didn't even have a website...had to get someone to translate a phone call to make a reservation. How the fuck are you going to find the place now?

Asking directions on darkened streets: I don't know what people are saying to me and they don't know what I'm saying to them.

So tired I would sleep in a barn right now, on a pile of hay. Absolutely. Where's the barn? I'm dead tired; beat. Almost desperate. This shit is Biblical.

Look how much fun I'm having.
