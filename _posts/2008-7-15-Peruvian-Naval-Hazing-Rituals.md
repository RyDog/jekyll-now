Once upon a time I was a Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve, and they sent me down to Panama for two weeks.  
They gave me a satellite phone and sent me out on a Peruvian warship for a week into the western Caribbean with the instructions “We’ll call you and tell you what to do.”
They never called, and I had nothing to do except sleep and the eventually drink two of the three bottles of rum I had brought aboard as gifts.   
When we finally pulled back into port in Panama after doing circles for a week, the Captain called the officers to the wardroom for a little ceremony.
I presented the remaining bottle of rum to the captain, and then we started doing toasts. 
i was given a shot of pisco and i could barely hold it down...foul stuff...and then another shot, and another.
I was on the verge of puking when the Executive Officer (XO) handed me a glass full of pisco and told me that i had to chug it. 
at that point i was already dizzy from drinking so much so quickly.  
i knew he was joking because it was not possible to drink this shit, so i was laughing and looking around but everyone was looking at me, staring with blank faces. 
and then i looked at the only guy who spoke English, MY AMIGO, looking for help and he just said, “You have to drink it all at once, it's a tradition.”
I knew i was fahked, and everyone just stood there looking at me and it started to get awkward. 
i knew i was going to throw up but i had no choice so i just slugged it and then closed my mouth really tight and when the throw-up came i just kept it in my mouth and breathed out of my nose and then swallowed it all back down.
Some of the puke went up my nose and was really burning but it was a Triumph.  I could not believe i had done it. 
then we drank more and i literally staggered off of the ship into a sweltering panamanian afternoon and tried to figure out how to get to our hotel. 
Damn Peruvians!
