title: Temple Shim'on

This massive domed building is a religious temple dedicated to a man named Shim'on Bar Yona.

Shim'on was a Jewish fisherman born about 2000 years ago in the Galilee area of Israel.

A devout religious Jew, he became a follower of an apocalyptic Jewish preacher and carpenter named Yeshua who was preaching in Galilee.

The Romans ("Rome") ruled the area where Shim'on and Yeshua lived, and eventually Yeshua pissed off the Romans. The Romans killed Yeshua. 

Actually, they tortured him to death in a gruesome public execution. At the time of his death Yeshua was in his early 30's and was almost completely unknown, even in Israel. But he had a small group of very devoted followers who believed that he had a special connection to the God that the Jews worshipped who is called Yehovah.

Eventually those followers would decide that, in fact, Yeshua and Yehovah were the same being - that Yeshua was Yehovah, but that took a while.

After Yeshua is killed by the Romans Shim'on starts traveling around the Mediterranean preaching this new form of the Jewish religion. 

Eventually he ends up in Rome where he wins converts, especially among the many Jews living in Rome at the time, but he pisses off the Romans. So, the Romans kill Shim'on. 

Actually, they tortured him to death in a gruesome public execution, in the same way they killed Yeshua. But this time they turn Shim'on upside down (or so tradition holds).

You might think the story would end there, but completely improbably, the religion Shim'on was preaching keeps growing. The Romans try to stamp it out and they execute and persecute the followers of Yeshua, but the movement continues to grow and then explodes. 

Within roughly 300 years this form of Judaism becomes the official religion of the Roman Empire and the Gods that the Romans had worshipped for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years disappear, replaced by Yehovah/Yeshua.

This temple, still one of the largest religious temples in the world, is built over the spot where tradition and some historical evidence holds that Shim'on Bar Yona, a poor jewish fisherman from Galilee, was buried after his execution. 

Today he is worshipped as a kind of minor God by followers of the faith. He has special powers and controls entry to heaven, among other things.

And this majestic building, a masterpiece of Renaissance architecture, is proof that Shim'on achieved, at the very least, a very rare kind of worldly immortality.
