title: A Love Story

He returned to their apartment from the nearby coffee shop where he had been working on his new project and, without speaking, sat down on the couch next to her.  She had been waiting for him in silence.  The day before he had returned from a solo five week international trip that had been the most intense of his traveling life, and he had only just begun the process of re-adjusting to life back at home -- a process that he would eventually decide took the better part of two weeks.  
 
They sat silently for a nearly a minute, almost touching, but neither looking at the other.  His silence was not calculated: he simply could not think of anything to say.  She knew what she wanted to say, but was waiting for the courage she knew would arrive, eventually.

When it did, she said, in a cold and flat tone that he did not recognize, “I’m moving out.”

In the weeks and months afterwards, when he would recall the moment she said those words, he would remember two things: the first was the strange sense that a woman he had never met before was uttering the words, and the second was the complete lack of emotion that he felt when he heard what she said to him.  

He would not remember being happy or sad or afraid or even indifferent -- he had not felt anything.  At that moment, he would decide, he was still in Diyarbakir or Tbilisi or Jerusalem, but he wasn’t on that couch.  

But he believed this woman.

He felt compelled to say something in reply,  but all he could offer, softly, was “When?”

He watched as she stood up, grabbed her backpack from the coffee table, and walked towards the door.  

Opening the door she turned to face him, looked directly into both of his eyes, and said, in the same unfamiliar tone, “I’ll be gone when you get back from the wedding you’re going to this weekend.”  


He immediately understood what she had not said, which was that he would be attending the wedding by himself.  Without her.  Alone.


She looked directly into his eyes, began to say something else, but stopped, and then turned and moved into the stairwell.  The metal door banged closed behind her.  To him the bang of the door seemed to echo through the room for several minutes.


Sitting on the couch, staring into the small space in front of him, he still felt nothing.  But soon his eyes became fixed on the large, potted Dieffenbachia beside the television.  They had picked it out together, and carried it home, he recalled.  No small task in New York City.


He noticed that the pot was surrounded by brown, dried leaves, and that the few leaves still attached to the plant were wilted and also brown or yellow.  The normally moist and even soil was dried out, and deep cracks were present in the surface.  


She had not watered the plant while he was gone, he realized.  Five weeks with no water.
