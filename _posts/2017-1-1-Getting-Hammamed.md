title: Getting Hammamed (In Search of Authentic Experience)

The exfoliating glove was shearing and sloughing off a slightly unnerving amount of skin from my recently tanned forearm. Is that what is supposed to happen? 

HE was impressed with his work. After he finished my left arm, he shoved the palm of the glove near my face and excitedly pointed at the white rolls of dead skin stuck to his glove as he directed a stream of strange grunting noises at me and the glove. Whoa, dude.

The glove smelled like mackerel. Canned mackerel. Or tuna. Take your pick, but the point is that this glove smelled fishy. It was then I also realized that he’d just used this glove on the guy he scrubbed before me. And there wasn’t a glass “barbasol” jar filled with green liquid to soak the thing in. Far from it. Ah, F**k. 

People who consider themselves travelers are often very concerned with authenticity and authentic experience. I am one of those people. Group tours or package tours are probably not authentic, for example. A typical package tour on sale in Istanbul might take you to a ‘real’ Turkish Hammam, and then later that evening to a dinner to see a ‘real’ Whirling Dervish show. “How can that be authentic?,” the traveler asks himself. And for $150, who can afford it? A lot of people, it turns out. But not travelers. Travelers cannot afford such things. 

To the traveler’s mind, things that are expensive are probably not authentic. Especially if I can’t afford them.

But visiting a Turkish Bath (or Hammam/i) in Turkey was on the top of my list of things to do. Hopefully several times. I investigated the scene in Istanbul, but what I found were very expensive Hammams that catered to tourists. Not authentic. 

Two that I saw on the inside had stunning lobbies, but at $50-$100 for a visit I couldn’t afford it anyways. My plan was to look for a Hammam elsewhere in Turkey, one that only local people used. I was sure it would be much cheaper as well. And Authentic.

I was on my way back from visiting the Cave Church of Saint Peter -- widely believed to have been dug by the Apostle Peter himself as a place for the early Christian community of Antioch to meet, and traditionally the first Christian church -- got lost in the old part of the city, turned a corner and saw the sign: “Hammami.”

Perfect timing. What could be better than an hour or two in a Real Turkish Bath right now, I thought? At the front desk in the lobby was a sign in Turkish that had the price of 12 Lira underneath it. 6 Bucks. Perfect. Everything looked really shabby. Faded glory. Definitely not the kind of place where I’d see other tourists. No, I was living like a local. Living authentically.

After some sign language with the man at the front desk, I was led to a series of terraced stone benches that lined the large lobby. I stripped naked in front of a half dozen men and put on my peştemal, a thin wrap they handed me, along with a pair of worn-out orange slide sandals 3 or 4 sizes too small. Next, I was led into a huge marble steam room. I was alone, and I had no idea what I was supposed to do. The room wasn’t particularly hot or steamy. Is this it? 

The room contained 5 smaller rooms, each with a marble stool, a marble basin, and hot and cold water taps. I went into one and started pouring hot water on myself, then cold water. I wasn’t sure if I was doing it right. Whatever. It’s an experience. Worst case I just sit in here for 20 minutes pouring water on myself, pay $6, and then leave. Right?

After 10 or 15 minutes HE came in.

I do not speak or understand Turkish, but Turkish spoken by a deaf man is somewhat comprehensible. In his 60 or so years his handicap had clearly forced him to develop a style of communication that was not dependent on others completely understanding his words. Pointing, touching, inflection, hand movements...plus grunting. He got his points across, and right now he wanted me to get out of this room and follow him.

I obeyed, and that’s how I found myself laying on the marble bench, trying to stay calm, as this older deaf man violently scrubbed me with a fishy exfoliating glove. 

After my arms he scrubbed my back, then my chest. Dead skin was flying everywhere. He pushed me backwards onto the marble bench, pulling each leg down until I was flat on my back, head resting on a slimy, water-logged and eroded wooden block. He’s in control of this situation...and wow, that block does not smell good either. This is becoming unpleasant.

Time for my legs. Feet, calves, and then very quickly his glove is up under my peştemal.

Way up. In order to apply maximum pressure into my inner thigh he is standing directly over me, arm extended down. He’s wearing the same thing that I am, and I notice that he’s missing most of his teeth. His white chest and belly are strangely devoid of hair. 

Up and down my inner thigh, up and down…must be getting a lot of skin, because this hurts. Every time he goes up my thigh the back on his glove rubs up against my scrotum, and a couple of time he gives me a very unwanted exfoliation with the business side of his glove. Oh. my. God. Stay Calm.

How long is this going to last? Ok, time for the other leg. Deep Breaths. Deep Breaths. 

Is this authentic enough?

He has me sit up. Pouring hot water on me, now cold water. I think it’s almost over. Seems like things are winding down. Maybe not.

Now he’s rubbing something on my head...what’s that? A bar of soap wrapped in a cloth bag? Ah, he’s washing my hair with a bar of soap...grunting...is that laughter? Cold water, hot water...a bit of soap in my eye...damn this stings. He’s pushing me back onto the marble but I can’t see anything because there’s soap in my eyes. 

Oh, now he’s scrubbing my chest with that bag of soap. I see, we’re going to do this all over again. We're about to do this whole thing over again but this time he's using a bag of soap. I'm going to get up and leave. I'm really going to just get up and leave. No you're not! 

Search for Authentic experiences and you might find them. But they might not be what you expected...

Arms, legs….oh shit. Up under my peştemal again...much more gentle this time...almost tender. Grunting…oh dear God…waaay up in my inner thighs...soap everywhere...slippery…definitely laughter now….the other leg, the other thigh….happy thoughts….

I give up…

Be gentle...

Is this authentic enough?

Very much so.
