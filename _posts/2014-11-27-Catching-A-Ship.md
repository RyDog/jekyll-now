title: catching a ship
---
You’re sitting in a corner booth against a window all the way in the back of an International House of Pancakes in Elizabeth, New Jersey on a Wednesday morning drinking your sixth cup of coffee while staring over and past a fake Louis Vuitton carry-on rolly bag stacked opposite you in your booth and out onto the diner’s parking lot which is nearly empty.

It’s cold - winter jacket weather - and it’s raining and has been raining all morning, or at least since 6:30AM when you stepped out onto the sidewalk in front of your friend’s apartment where you were crashing for the night in one of the just-beginning-to-gentrify sections of Bed Stuy, Brooklyn - the kind of block with a Rastafarian Temple on the corner. 

The sky is densely overcast, and everything you can see from your booth, which is not much other than the parking lot and its cars and beyond that the traffic lights of a four way intersection, is bathed in the sun’s filtered grey light. You imagine the clouds stacked for miles above the low, dark floor above the IHOP, and imagine the draining struggle the light endures before emerging, faintly, above the diner. 

Your long, unfocused stare is broken when you notice that the rain is beginning to behave strangely, becoming lighter, dancing horizontally, and as you focus on the movement of the falling water you start to realize, reluctantly, that it is no longer only raining, but is beginning to snow. 

You are not expecting snow, especially given that it was quote unquote T-Shirt Weather two days ago when you arrived in New York from Florida, but there is no denying the troubling fact. With the arrival of the snow the light outside becomes even fainter - weaker - and as you watch the transition from rain to snow you begin to feel your mind’s gyroscope sorta wobble, sorta lose its tight spin, and things begin to feel out of balance. 

You have been sitting here for 3 hours, or since the cab driver dropped you off here after the gate guard told you that your ship was delayed until noon, and in that time you have not felt any loss of nerve or purpose. But with the arrival of this snow - the first snow you have seen in 8 months - you suddenly realize, like, actually come to this realization that you’re sitting alone in an IHOP in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and then you start thinking, really thinking about the reason you’re here and this deep doubt starts to burrow it’s way into your mind, or more likely just emerge from some internal crack and the gyro starts to get all kinds of wobbly and starts to vibrate. And all of this because it is beginning to snow, you wonder? 

You start to think about how quickly all of this has happened, the past few days filled with action and movement and maybe you just have not been thinking clearly. How crazy does it seem that at any minute a taxi is going to pull up to this diner in Jersey and take you a couple of miles to the port where you’ll board a ship, in the snow, with 20 other men you’ve never met and then a few hours later you’ll be off to sea for months, across oceans and through all kinds of bizarre experiences? 

You don’t even know if you still remember how to do the job - it has been 5 years - and what if you make a huge mistake and get someone killed and then you wonder what the state of your mind must be for you to even be sitting here in the first place about to do something that you swore to anyone who would listen that you would never, ever do again. 

You start to feel detached from your body, not in a floating above everything sort of way, but you do catch shots of yourself from across the restaurant, sitting in this booth and it looks like a scene from a movie. The guy is clearly struggling with something and trying to decide if he really wants to go through with it. Maybe he’s about to meet up with two other men he does not know and then go a few miles away and rob a bank with them. Maybe the snow has him suddenly wondering if he should just bolt from the diner and never look back. Just call the whole thing off and renounce the life of crime, move to a little beach town in Mexico and change his name and never use a computer again. Just disappear.

You feel blood pumping through a vein in your neck, squeezing: wahwump wahwump wahwump, you can hear it in your ears. Heart beat quickening. You feel beads of sweat beginning to form on your face. 

Mexico sounds good, you tell yourself. Or Patagonia, like Butch and Sundance. You feel pressure building in your chest cavity, breathing is becoming more difficult, and your mind is becoming a snow globe of thoughts and doubts. 

Now, the other way. All of the mind's motion reverses and actually now is the perfect time to grow up, you decide. When the driver arrives you will have him take you to the nearest PATH station and then you’ll take the train to the bus station in Manhattan near Penn Station and buy a ticket on a Greyhound back to Florida. You can afford that.

Resume. You have to put together a resume. Should be straightforward. Then get a real job. A mortgage, start saving for retirement. Stability, that’s what you need right now, you realize. This whole quote Plan that you have is crazy, this lifestyle that you want to lead too unconventional. Your visions, surely manifestations of madness. More likely delusion. 

It occurs to you that a ship at sea is the last place in the world you should be right now. What were you thinking?

You look outside and see that the snow is thickening, collecting on the asphalt - more white than black now. Visibility is decreasing, clouds becoming denser, taller, darker - the light, lighter. How much coffee have you had to drink, you wonder. You know you need to relax. Regain control of yourself, man!

Your eyes close and you start with a few intentional breaths, in and out, in and out, thinking about control. Your breathing becomes rhythmic and you put the movie on pause, Mexico on pause, the resume on pause. In and out, in and out, you summon focus and strength from a deep, faithful place and you are saying something about how you made a firm decision that you were going to remain positive and hopeful and at the very least stoic about the whole situation and about the reason that you are here and what you’re here to do and why you spent $167 on a one way flight from Florida and $97 on a taxi this morning to end up sitting in this depressing fucking diner in Jersey. You’re fighting back. 

And then a soothing voice, perhaps your own, is saying that you will not view this snow as some kind of Sign or, you know, Omen. You are Detached, the snow doesn’t Mean anything and it will have no impact on whether or not any of your recent decisions were good or bad decisions in the long term. You trust this voice, you believe it. You’re leaving the diner, going deeper. Deeper.

Deeper, and deeper and then you’re searching for the core, trying to touch it, and you are getting close. Trying to get down to bare metal, polished, shiny, hot. Truth. There it is.

You open your eyes and your taxi is parked outside, headlights on, waiting for you. You grab your rolly bag, pull out the handle and drag it through the restaurant and then outside, into the snow. By the time the car is pulling away on the short drive back to the port your gyro is spinning tightly again, humming along and everything is under control. 

But you know there was a moment back there where it could have definitely gone the other way.
