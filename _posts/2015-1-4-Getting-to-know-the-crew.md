Notes: Getting to Know the Crew

[Bottom Picture]:

8x12 AB (Middle):
We don’t know much about him. He’s Filipino, does not have any teeth on the top row, and cannot speak English. Nothing that he says can be understood by anyone. It’s unclear how he ever passed any examinations of any kind to get the credential he presumably possesses that enables him to hold his current job. 

Steward’s Department (Chief Cook, left ; Chief Steward, right):
Both Indonesian, they are extremely good natured, friendly, and run an excellent kitchen. They speak to each other in Indonesian. We don’t know much about them, but the second mate imagines them being involved in committing horrible atrocities during the Indonesian civil war, and being haunted by the images of death and depravity that they witnessed and participated in. But we don’t actually know much of anything about them.

12x4 AB (santa hat):
a self-described Hill-Billy from the Pocono mountains of Pennsylvania, the 12x4 AB is a watchstanding AB, meaning that his primary duty is to stare out of the bridge windows for 8 hours every day looking for ships, and reporting anything that he sees to the Mate on Watch. 
He possesses an unusual talent: He can stand on the dead centerline of the bridge and for an hour or more give every outward appearance that he is looking out at the sea, scanning for contacts. His eyes will be open, his head will occasionally move from side to side, although only slightly, and he will appear awake and alert. Yet somehow can manage to not actually see or report contacts that are obviously visible to even the casual observer. It’s a remarkable talent. 
When he is not working on a ship, he tries to accomplish as little as possible when home, which is half of the year. He describes his day as not beginning, meaning he does not leave his bed, until he has watched the Price is Right. And his day ends, every single day, with him finishing an 18 pack of Busch or Busch Light beer in his back yard. He budgets $20 per day, or $600 per month to his drinking. $5 in gas to drive his truck to the package store, and $15 for an 18 pack of beer. 
He only returns to sea when he is completely broke, and often has to sell vehicles or other property to make ends meet while looking for a ship.

2nd Engineer (back right):
Raised in Brooklyn, his parents moved the family to rural Maine when he was in High School. In response, he ran away and ended up as a homeless youth in Anchorage, Alaska. After a night of drinking and drugs with another homeless youth he was living with under a bridge, they stole a van and crashed it into several parked cars. His friend was severely injured, but he fled the scene, leaving his friend behind. To get out of town and stay ahead of the law, he signed on as a deckhand on a fishing boat and he seagoing career was launched. He eventually earned his coast guard engineering license, and he has used the money he has made at sea to buy a 10 unit apartment building in Portland, Maine. Before he left on this most recent trip, he rented one of the units to an attractive 26 year old woman. His plan is to return to Portland after this trip and impregnate the woman during the roughly three months he will be home before he returns to sea. He feels that this is the best way to ensure that she does not cheat on him while he’s at sea. 
He is still haunted by the fact that he left his injured and bleeding friend behind in the van.

The Bosun (ball cap): 
Of Puerto Rican descent, he does not actually speak Spanish but that does not stop him from peppering his speech with the occasional palabra de Espanol mi amigo. It never fails to catch people off guard. 
When the Bosun is trying to get his point across – trying to get someone to catch his drift – he repeats everything he is saying at least 6 times. He does not say the thing he’s trying to convey 6 different ways, but simply says the exact same sentence or sentences at least 6 times in a row. It quickly becomes clear that only the First time is for the person he’s speaking to – the other five are for himself.
He enjoys talking about having sex with women, and it is the only thing he talks about other than work. He has many interesting nautical euphemisms for the Act, but his favorite is to “Sougee the Boom” – “sougee” being a nautical term meaning to scrub or scour, and boom being the arm of a ship’s crane.
He also refers to the Act as “Two-Blocking It.” In nautical terminology a ship's rigging or crane rigging is “two-blocked” when two blocks or pulleys are locked together, preventing a line from moving any further. 
If the Bosun is happy with someone he will refer to them as “PahPah,” but if he is unhappy with someone he will refer to that person as “Guy,” as in “Listen Guy….”

2nd Mate (back left):
A mysterious character, he does not say much about himself or his background. He asks a lot of questions about his shipmates’ lives, and seems genuinely interested in them, but it’s unclear why. He is an average mate and does an average job. He does not seem to have much ambition to become the captain of a ship or to rise above his current station in life. He was recently seen on the bow of the ship, in the middle of the ocean at dusk yelling and cursing at the setting Sun. Overall, his shipmates have a slightly unsettled feeling towards him.
