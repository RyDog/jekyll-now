title: Medger Evers House 
---
I left New Orleans and drove north through Mississippi until I got to Jackson where I stopped to pay a visit to a Civil Rights landmark, the Medgar Evers House and Museum. 
On June 12, 1963 Medgar Evers was assassinated here in his carport at the age of 37. Evers was a civil rights activist and the NAACP's first field secretary for Mississippi. 
Evers worked to overturn segregation at the University of Mississippi, secure voting rights for African Americans and other changes in the segregated South. 
He was shot in the back as he was getting out of his car by a member of the White Citizens' Council, a group formed to resist integration of schools and civil rights activity. 
He was driven to the local hospital in Jackson where he was initially refused entry because of his race, but he was eventually admitted, and died in the hospital less than an hour later. 
All-white juries failed to reach verdicts in the first two trials of the assassin, but in 1994 he was convicted in a new state trial based on new evidence.
Evers, a military veteran, was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.
In 1969, Medgar Evers College was established in Brooklyn, New York, as part of the City University of New York.
In 1992, the city of Jackson erected a statue in honor of Evers and part of U.S. Highway 49 in Jackson was renamed in Evers' honor. 
In 2004, the Jackson City Council changed the name of the city's airport to "Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport" in his honor.
Evers is remembered for saying "You can kill a man, but you can't kill an idea."
