This job is all about moving the boxes.

Load the boxes in one port, drive them to another port, unload them and then load some more. Repeat. 

The boxes are 8 feet wide, 8.5 feet high, and – with some exceptions – either 20 or 40 feet long. Other than boxes that contain hazardous cargo, we generally have no idea what is inside. They're just boxes. 

It takes a lot of people to get a ship loaded with several hundred or several thousand of these boxes and the ship’s crew never see or are even aware of the existence of most of those people other than in some abstract way. Many of them work in air conditioned offices, and many others drive trucks, or work in warehouses and storage yards.

But we do see the “Lashers,” the tip of the spear. These are the guys who secure the boxes to the deck of the ship using heavy steel lashing equipment: lashing rods, turnbuckles, stacking cones and twistlocks. They work near open cargo holds where they could fall to their deaths, and under the 30 ton boxes suspended from gantry cranes. They unlash the containers when the ship arrives, and then lash them new containers that are loaded. This is physically demanding, dirty, and dangerous work.

It’s unusual to have an opportunity to talk to a lasher, but yesterday in Colombo things were slow on my watch and I got the chance to meet Shasi, one of the guy’s lashing our ship. Shasi is 26 years old and lives with his father in Colombo. He speaks a broken, conversational English that he says he must have learned from watching Hollywood movies, although he prefers Bollywood. 

His mother works in Saudi Arabia as a domestic servant to make money for the family. She is currently on a three year contract, which allows her one month of vacation back home in Sri Lanka after 18 months.

Shasi is a Buddhist, but he has notions of God that seem to be heavily influenced by Hinduism. Sri Lanka is a fascinating religious melting pot. Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam all have significant communities within the country, and as you walk around Colombo you will see temples to all of those religions – often side by side.

After a few minutes of talking I asked Shasi if I could take a picture of him. He agreed and I used my iPhone to get some snaps. He admired my phone, and asked me how much it cost. I told him it was probably about $500, and he just shook his head and said “impossible.” He meant that it was impossible that he would ever have a phone like that. 

We started talking about money. Shasi works 4 days per week at the port, 12 hours at a time, and then has 2 days off. For each 12 hour shift he is paid 1050 Rupees, which is about $8 at the current exchange rate of 130 Rupees to the US dollar. Pulling out my calculator, I realized that this man and other lashers around me were making about 67 cents per hour to do this punishing, treacherous work that offers the very real opportunity for serious injury or death at all times. 

When he asked me how much money I made, I could not think of what to say. First I thought about lying, but then I realized that any realistic lie I could come up with would still be an embarrassing amount of money compared to the $168 per month that he is earning. I just smiled and made an awkward noise and waved my hands around. We moved along.

In ports of the Middle East, especially the wealthy countries around the Persian Gulf, many of the lashers are from countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and India. I know something about the lives that they live once they sign on for two or three year contracts that amount to something very close to slavery. 

The lashers and other longshoremen often live in refitted shipping containers with bunks for 10 or 20 men, work 12 or 16 hour shifts 6 days a week and are often not allowed to leave the port areas where they live and work. They have few rights, very little control over their lives, and are paid wages relative to what the average citizen of the host countries earn that seem unfair by most western standards. 

But those wages are a fortune to someone like Shasi. If he were to sign on to go work at a port in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, for example, for doing the same job (although working more hours) he would make about 150,000 Rupees per month ($1,150). That is 7x what he is currently being paid.

But he’s not interested in leaving Sri Lanka, at least not yet. 

If he gets married and has children, however, then he says that he will probably have to go live the life of an indentured servant abroad. Which will also mean that he will rarely get to see the family that he has left the country to support. 

Or, he might be able to convince his wife to go live the life of a modern day slave in some far away land. That’s what his Dad did.

As I trudged up the ladder to my room at 4 am after finishing my cargo watch and my conversation with Shasi, I was feeling grateful. Just a deep and general feeling of gratitude (with a little bit of guilt mixed in).
