I paid a visit to hemingway's grave in Ketchum, Idaho today.  
hemingway killed himself with a long-barreled side-by-side 12 gauge shotgun inside his Ketchum home on July 2, 1961.  
Shortly after the suicide the gun was given to a local welder who smashed the stock, cut up the steel parts, and buried what was left in a field.

In a Paris Review interview Norman Mailer was asked of Hemingway's suicide, "Did it compromise your sense of his courage?"  
Mailer replied, "I hated to think that his death might do that, so I came up with a thesis: Hemingway had learned early in life that the closer he came to daring death the healthier it was for him. He saw that as the great medicine, to dare to engage in a nearness to death. And so I had this notion that night after night when he was alone, after he said goodnight to Mary, Hemingway would go to his bedroom and he’d put his thumb on the shotgun trigger and put the barrel in his mouth and squeeze down on the trigger a little bit, and—trembling, shaking—he’d try to see how close he could come without having the thing go off. On the final night he went too far. That to me made more sense than him just deciding to blow it all to bits. However, it’s nothing but a theory. The fact of the matter is that Hemingway committed suicide."

On the grave were coins, dollar bills, pens, a 24 hours of sobriety Alcoholics Anonymous chip ("To thine own self be true"), a bottle of whiskey, beers (I opened one and took a sip), pens, and a paperback copy of The Sun Also Rises. There was a bookmark in the book where a passage was outlined in pen. 

The passage, from chapter 4, reads "I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. Then I couldn’t keep away from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it went away. I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around and started to go in sort of smooth waves. Then all of a sudden I started to cry. Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I went to sleep."
