Everyone: Cheer up. Think: You could be this horse, tied to a tractor in a junkyard in a small town in Mexico (El Rosario, Baja Norte) with the midday sun lashing you. 
But you're not. Instead, you're tied to something else, in your own town, with your own junkyard of problems, with different things lashing you and bills, addictions, compulsions, self destructive patterns you keep repeating, nightmares, heartbreaks....ah shit, you know what? 
it's very possible this horse is better off than many of you. He has a big bucket of water over there, seems well fed and has a nice sheen. He's a very peaceful horse, seems quite contented with the world and his place in it, probably gets ridden often and the sun doesn't bother him because he is covered with hair. 
So, never mind. But don't forget about this horse. There could come a time when you need him. . .
