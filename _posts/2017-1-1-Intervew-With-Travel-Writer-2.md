title: Interviews with a Travel Writer (#2)
---
+Interviewer: Everything you write seems to be about yourself. Have you considered trying to write fiction where you create characters, or writing about other people?

G.O.:  “I have thought about it. But I just started writing, and what came out was this first person story about my real life. That’s what interests me, I guess.
I have been thinking lately about how much time some writers spend inventing characters. Writers talk about how they “live” with these characters and sympathize with them and all of that.
I think my idea is: why not just become a character? I have to live with myself, so why not just become someone that I want to hang out with, someone that I am interested in and want to read about and write about?
Why not make my life so interesting and so filled with other interesting people and events that I don’t need to invent anything. I just have to travel and explore and connect and write down what’s happening.
Maybe I'm just lazy. Maybe narcissistic. I don’t really care.”

+Interviewer: It sounds like you want to be a travel writer. Would you say that is fair?


G.O.:  “Maybe what I want to do is more like acting than writing. Think about the process that Daniel Day Lewis goes through to become a character. Lewis wants to become Daniel Plainview in “There Will be Blood”, and he becomes Daniel Plainview. It’s astonishing to watch that man in a film.
I’ve read that on the set he stays in character. You know, he’s sitting over in the corner in between scenes and in his mind he’s Daniel Plainview. Don’t talk to me. Somebody goes over to him to ask him if he would like a bottle of water and he’s like I’ll drink your f***ing Milkshake motherfu***r, and so forth.
But I think about this: what if at the end of the Filming of "There Will be Blood," Lewis actually becomes Daniel Plainview. You know, he can’t go back. He was on a one way street.
That’s what I want to do with my thinking and writing and exploring. I want to become Giovanni O’Neil. I want to become this character that I’m inventing.
That seems like less work and more fun.”
