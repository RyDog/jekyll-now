title: Clinton Oval Office Photo Hack
---

Bill Clinton built a full scale replica of the Oval Office at his monument to himself in Little Rock, Arkansas. 
It's very cool, and I say it's worth the $10 admission fee to the monument just to be able to hang out in this fake version of the most famous of rooms. 

You can get a picture of yourself sitting in the chair looking presidential, but you have to go through Bill's photographer, who charges $16.50. 
I'm sure he does a great job, but no personal photography is allowed in the room. 

However, a little hack for those on a budget is that there is no rule preventing you from being photographed at the desk by someone who is standing outside of the office.
So i saw this good ole' boy with a nice camera in there poking around the office and I asked him if he wanted to do an ole swaparoo, I shoot him behind the desk and then he shoots me. 
He was reluctant but finally agreed. 

He didn't turn out to be much of a photographer.  In his pictures of me sitting at the desk I'm out of focus and the light is off.  But Thanks dude! 
You get what you pay for folks. 

Btw, Google 'Bill Clinton Cigar." 
The first result is a great academic paper titled "a psychological study of President William Jefferson Clinton." 
It's written from a Freudian perspective. Pseudo Science. 

Bill is a genius. A brilliant guy, really. And he balanced the budget. who else has done that?
