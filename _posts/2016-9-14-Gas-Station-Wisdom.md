title: gas station wisdom

I left Memphis this morning, crossed the Mississippi River and kept on going down i40, passing farms and farms and farms. 
I couldn't even tell what they were growing. 
It looked like weeds and dust. 

I had to get some gas eventually and I pulled off the highway into some little town and filled up then went in and grabbed a pack of sunflower seeds and a gallon of water. 
That's the real value, buying the gallon. 
When I got to the register the lady said, "ya know those seeds are two for a dollar." 
She was right. I went and grabbed another. 

She rang me up and then I asked her, "what's it like living here?" 

"I suspect it's the same as a lot of other places," she said.

I said, "well, do you like living around here?" 

She said, "sometimes I do, sometimes I don't." 

I enquired further, "is there a lot of crime around here?" 

She said, "sometimes there's crime, but there's crime everywhere." 

Indeed, I said. 

I walked out, got in my car full of fuel and drove back out onto the highway, heading west.

What wisdom, I was thought. What incredible wisdom.

I could go climb a mountain in India and might not find wisdom like that at the top. 

Onward...

Westward...to Little Rock...
