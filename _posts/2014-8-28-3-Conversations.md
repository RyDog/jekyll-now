"Jerusalem Syndrome: Mental phenomena involving the presence of either religiously themed obsessive ideas, delusions or other psychosis-like experiences that are triggered by a visit to the city of Jerusalem."

Conversation #1  
I had just spent an hour visiting the 'Western Wall' in Jerusalem, Judaism's holiest site. The wall is what's left of the 2nd Jewish Temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70AD -- a watershed moment in the history of Judaism.

In the place where the Temple once stood, and just above the Western Wall, now stands the Dome of the Rock, one of the holiest sites in Islam. Shit's complicated here.

As I'm leaving the site, walking on a street near the the Wall, a young man, casually dressed and wearing a yarmulke speaks to me: 'Hey, I saw you at the wall, didn't I?'

'Yeah, Maybe? I was just there.'

'You looked like you were having a deep experience there, were you praying?'

'No, I wasn't praying.'

'Are you Jewish?'

'No, I'm not Jewish.'

'What are you?'

'Umm, I don't know man. I guess right now I Am trying to get back to the convent where I'm staying to take a shower.'

'Haha, you're funny. Well I believe in God, do you believe in God?'

At this point I realize this guy is about to start preaching to me, but I'm not sure what he's selling, so I just go with it...

'What God do you believe in?' I ask him.

"There is only one God, but I follow someone named Rebbe Nachman, have you heard of him?"

'No.'

'He is from Ukraine. The Rebbe told us that we are so close to God that we can speak to him just like he is our best friend. God IS our best friend; he's my best friend! I talk to God all the time, and the Rebbe said we should serve God with Joy! And, my friend, the Rebbe said that God is not just for Jews, he is for everyone. He is for you."

"Oh, do you believe the Rebbe is the Messiah?" 

"He is what we call a Tzaddik, and he might be the Messiah...we're not sure yet. But the Rebbe made a promise that no one else has ever made! I promise you, no one else has ever made this promise. He said that when he died, whoever will travel to Rebbe's grave in a place called Uman in the Ukraine will be saved and cleansed by the Rebbe, no matter how serious his sins and the bad things that he's done!"

"Oh really? The Rebbe will save you, like Jesus?"

"Something like that. The Rebbe will save you from hell! I have been to Uman 4 times, and it's an amazing experience. Last year we were 40,000 people there praying! It was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced in my life. "

"Wow."

"Listen, it seems like you're interested in learning more...I have a special feeling about you my friend. There's something special about you, I'm sure of it. Why don't you come with me now to our cafe? We have free food and coffee and you can meet some of my friends? And then if you like us, you could come with us to Uman in September to pray at the Rebbe's grave."

Wow, this is an incredible offer, I think to myself. A guy just offered me a path to be cleansed of all of my misdeeds and to be saved from spending time in Hell, which doesn't sound like a pleasant place. All I have to do right now is follow him to a cafe and drink some coffee. 

I'm tired, but I begin imagining what my life could look like if I take him up on his offer: 

I go back with him for coffee, they tell me about the Rebbe, and I like what I hear. After a couple of more days of hanging out with them, their passion for the Rebbe overwhelms me. I don't really have anything better to do, so I tell them that I'm in. I am down with the Rebbe. 

Of course, I'm going to join an ultra orthodox sect of messianic Jewish mystics, then I'm not going half way in; I'm going all the way in. I move to Jerusalem and engage in the intense study that will be required to become Jewish and fluent in the Hebrew Scriptures. Learning the Hebrew language is going to be a very high priority.

Circumcision, the biggest stumbling block for many male adult converts, has already been taken care of, so I'm good there. But I'll need new clothes: I'm going to be adopting the Hasidic style of my new friends: black trousers, white shirt, black jacket, black shoes, black socks, black hat. Deciding what to wear each day is going to be really easy. 

Because the bible says "Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard" (Leviticus 19:27 KJV) my new hairstyle will include payot, the long, uncut sideburns, and I'll stop shaving my beard. 

I'll spend my days praying, studying holy scripture, and sweating my ass off in the Jerusalem heat in my new clothes. Eventually, when I'm spiritually prepared, I'll focus on my life's work: bringing new members to the faith. I will become the St. Paul of Uman, the apostle to the Gentiles. Very quickly, I'll be bringing 5 or 6 new prospects in to the coffee house each day, and I'll convert at least 50%. Harnessing the power of technology, I'll organize armies of people around the world to spread the good word about the Rebbe. 

Within 50 years there will be more people praying at the Rebbe's grave in Uman, Ukraine during Rosh HaShanah than there are at Mecca during the Hajj. I'll become a famous Rebbe myself, and before I die I'll tell my followers that if they come to my gravesite in northern Florida and recite the songs that I've written, I will save them from a place even worse than hell. And I will be immortal.

And all of this for the Glory of God, alone (i.e. not for me), of course.

But, it's been 3 days since I've had a shower, and it's almost dark. As tempting as a shot at immortality is, I really just want go back to the convent with a couple of beers, take a shower, and do some writing.

So I decline his offer, say goodbye, and keep walking.

Conversation #2  
The next day, I am out exploring more of Jerusalem's old city. Walking near Jaffa Gate I see a sign for "Christ Church, Jerusalem," which I've read about. Christ Church is an Anglican church established in 1849, and it is the oldest Protestant church in the Middle East.

I walk past the guesthouse that fronts the road, and then down a narrow driveway to the back of the property where the church is located. As I'm climbing the stairs to go inside, I hear a loud voice behind me say, in a very southern-American drawl, "haaay! Come over here and I'll give you the tour!"

The tour, huh? I walk over to the table where this southern man is sitting, and at his invitation, I sit down as well. He pours me a glass of cold water, which is very refreshing on this hot day, and we engage in some chit chat about the Old City. Then he asks me, "So, are you Jewish?"

When I tell him that I'm not Jewish, he seems, momentarily, very disappointed. But he quickly recovers and says, "Well let's start the tour!" Sitting at the table, he launches into a long speech that he's clearly practiced and delivered many times.

"Ok, 1830, what happens? The printing press is invented, right? And what's the first book that is printed? The bible! So..."

He is just getting on a roll, but I can't resist interrupting him by asking, "are you sure the printing press was invented in 1830? Wasn't it more like 1430?"

"Well, I've heard that question before, so I looked it up, and I found out that it was actually 'invented,' like technically invented in 1830, but it may have been used earlier than that."

"Umm, ok," I say, trying to figure out if this guy is a little crazy or a little slow. 

"So anyways, printing press means that people can read the bible for themselves, they don't have to go through the Catholic Church. So what do you get? The reformation! People actually going back to read the bible and see what it says. And all these years since Jesus was crucified, Christians have been wondering why Jesus hasn't returned yet. And nobody can figure out why, because they were expecting the second coming to have happened already. Well, guess what?! A group of people in England - Anglicans - they start figuring this stuff out by reading the scriptures. And what they realize is that Jesus isn't going to return until the Jews return to the land of Israel. So they form an organization called the "London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews." And they start preaching the gospel to Jews, first in London, but eventually in the Holy Land here in Jerusalem. And they were the first Zionists! They were calling for the creation of Israel even before Jews were. Anyways, they started hospitals, and especially schools here for Jewish girls, and that helped them to convert many Jews to become followers of Yeshua. Schools are great for missionary work. But come on, let's go inside the church."

We walk up the stairs and into the church, and I'm my first thought upon seeing the inside is that it looks like a synagogue on the inside. 

"Ok, tell me what you do NOT see in here? Huh, what do you NOT see," he adds again for emphasis.

"I don't know...what?"

"A cross! You don't see a cross. And you know why you don't see a cross? Because to a Jew, a cross looks like a sword. And they think that sword is going to be used to kill them, ok. So there aren't any crosses in here."

I look up at a beautiful series of stained glass windows on the opposite, altar side, of the church and see in the dead-center what looks very much like a large cross formed by the intersection of the trunk and branches of a tree. "Well, that looks like a cross up there."

"No, no. That's not a cross. That's a tree. That's not a cross."

I let it go.

"The whole place has been designed to make Jews feel comfortable when they walk in here. They think it's a synagogue, and so then that's a really good point for us to start a conversation with them about the Hebrew Scriptures and about our belief that Yeshua is the Messiah who fulfills the prophesies of scripture. And because of this work that we've done over the last 200 plus years, we have a huge Messianic Jewish congregation here, and we're bringing in more Jews all the time. The state of Israel has been established, and the Jews have largely returned to Eretz Israel, and scripture is being fulfilled! We are actually bringing about the return of Jesus."

This man's passion is very real, and he is very serious. But his confusion over when the printing press was invented does make me wonder about the soundness of his scriptural interpretation. 

I tell him that I've been studying the Bible and that I have developed a special interest in Jewish and Christian Apocalyptic beliefs and theology. "Wars and rumors of war!, ya know." 

We have a laugh over that one. Then he starts telling me about himself:

"You know I'm just a volunteer here. I get free room and board, and I work for the church and do these tours and other missionary work. I've been here for two years and I love it. We have bible study every day and I'm learning something new every 30 minutes. Every 30 minutes! And look, I don't believe that Jews who don't believe are going to hell. Other people are, but I don't believe Jews are. But I struggle with that scripturally every day. And I was a sinner before I came here. Believe me on that. I'm from Florence, South Carolina but I lived in Las Vegas for many years and I did a lot of bad things. Alcohol, cocaine, prostitutes, and gambling was just what my life revolved around. But I found out that I was Jewish on my mothers side - my grandmother tried to hide it - and I came here to visit my mother for a week two years ago and haven't left. I have been born again, brother. I have been washed in the blood of the lamb. I love it here."

And then he pitches me:

"And you know what, you could live here too. Listen, we could really use someone like you around here. I think you'd be a really effective missionary. We have spots open! Why don't you come down to the office and learn more?"

I haven't even been in this city for a full 24 hours, I realize. Looking up at the tree that is not a Cross, I imagine what my life could look like if I follow him to the office:

The pitch is good. Certainly they are offering more than just a 9-5 job. They are offering the opportunity to bring about the return of Yeshua, the destruction of the earth...the Apocalypse. So there's a mission. 

Obviously, the conversion of a Jew is much more valuable than the conversion of a Muslim, a Catholic, or a person of some other faith. Maybe 1,000 times more valuable, because with every Jewish convert we'd be getting closer to Jesus' return, whereas when converting a Muslim I would only be saving one soul...and making no progress towards the return. So I'd have to be very careful about where I focused my time and energy. I'd probably write a manual about proselytizing, perhaps create an app for the church to distribute. A relative point system would have to be instituted, ordering the value of each convert: 
-Catholic: 1 point
-person of no faith: 10 points
-Muslim: 50 points
-Jew: 1000 points

I'd have a leaderboard put up in the guesthouse and create a competition whereby......

Nah. Nah, nah. What the fuck is wrong with me. I need some water. This city is really fucking crazy, I begin to realize. I was just trying to have a look inside an old church!

I wish him the best of luck with his work, and depart, quickly. As I'm walking back down the narrow driveway, towards the street, I hear him yelling at someone else: "haaay! Come over here and I'll give you the tour!"

Conversation #3  
Around noon on my 3rd day in Jerusalem I walked from the convent towards the entrance to the Al-Aqsa 
Mosque, near Lion's Gate, hoping to visit this very famous mosque. Two kids were walking ahead of me, and I saw them walk through the guarded entrance to the mosque area. The entrance was manned by Israeli police. As soon as they saw me they started angrily yelling at me to go away.

"Muslims only. Go Away. GO AWAY." 

I continued to approach the entrance, and one of the guards stood up carrying an assault rifle and walked toward me, continuing to yell. 

"I want to go to he mosque."

"This is only for Muslims! You are not a Muslim! Go Away!"

"How do you know I'm not a Muslim? White people can't be Muslims?"

He continued to yell at me, and then his colleagues joined him;

"Are you a Muslim?, he asks me.

"Maybe I am," I reply.

Then he asks me something about the Koran in Arabic and I tell him I only speak English.

"Any Muslim, even Muslims who don't speak Arabic know what that means. You aren't Muslim. Get out of here!

The moment was over. These Israeli policemen were not going to let me visit the mosque, but they seemed quite prepared to arrest me, or worse. Walking away from the scene, back into the maze of alleys in the old city's Arab quarter, I realized that I had just scratched the surface of this tensest of all cities. There is violence underneath. 

10 minutes later, in the Arab quarter, I'm approached by a young man, around 25, who looks and is dressed exactly like what you would expect a "Muslim" to look like. He's wearing a dark thawb, the ankle-length, long-sleeved tunic commonly worn by Arab men, his head is covered by a taqiyah, the rounded skullcap worn for religious purposes, and he is sporting a long beard. 

"Hello my friend, are you lost?"

"No, I'm not. But I just tried to visit Al Aqsa and they wouldn't let me go past the entrance!"

"Oh my friend, that is the Israelis. They are occupying our mosque and they only let Muslims in because some Jews have done shootings and killed Muslims at our mosque."

{I have no idea if any Jews have killed people at the mosque or in the mosque complex. But I heard stuff like this frequently from Palestinians.}

"Where are you from my friend?"

"I'm American."

"Oh, very good! Very good! We love America. Are you Muslim?"

"No, I'm not."

"Oh, well that is ok my friend. Do you know about Jesus?"

"Yes, I do know about Jesus."

"That is great my friend. Did you know that we Muslims believe in Jesus? Did you know that? And do you know who is the number one woman in Islam? Maria, Jesus' mother! She is number 1 woman. We call Jesus Issa. He is a great prophet in Islam. We believe in one God. Jews, Christians and Muslims, we all worship the same god: Allah."

This guy enjoys talking, and I let him. We're joined by two other guys who are dressed and groomed in the same manner as the talker, as well as an older man who seems to be their leader. They're surrounding me.

"My friend, Jesus was a Muslim, we know that, it's in the Quran. The Jews, they will say 'Jesus is a liar," or they will say 'Jesus was not real.' But Muslims, we believe in Jesus. And you my friend, you can believe in Jesus and Allah."

This is a very interesting pitch, I think to myself. I can believe in Jesus And Allah. They have a tailored pitch to people like me; I'm impressed.

"My friend, you seem like you want to learn more about Islam. You seem very interested. I want to give you something."

He hands me an English pamphlet titled 'What is Islam.' It's already the 3rd time I've been handed this exact pamphlet by a Muslim in the Holy Land. And then his friend hands me a small English Koran.

"My friend, I want you to learn more about Islam. I want you to understand our religion so that you can go back to America and tell people that Islam is a religion of peace. We run a school near here. We all came here today in our school van. And we come to Jerusalem and invite people like you to come live with us for 3 or 4 days to learn about Islam. Everything is free. You eat with us and sleep with us and we study together. You can leave whenever you want. We bring you back here in the van."

He hands me another pamphlet about the school, and and a business card. "These guys are serious," I say to myself. 

"So, what do you think? You want to learn about Islam?"

A random thought enters my mind at this moment: the word "conversation" and the word "conversion" are very similar aren't they?

And then I begin to imagine how my life might be changed by getting in the van with these Muslim gentlemen...

On the fourth day at the school, things will finally click for me. Deep in prayer at the mosque, God will speak to me, And I'll come to an ultimate understanding that the Koran truly is God's final revelation, and that Jesus really was a Muslim. I'll discover that everything in the 'What is Islam' pamphlet is true, and that man does truly find complete fulfillment and purpose of life by living in total submission to Allah.

I'll learn Arabic, and study the Koran. Learning that the Koran allows a man to have 4 wives, I will make this a goal. Although I possess deeply held Western beliefs about the equality of man and woman, I will acknowledge that a part of me has always been attracted to Muslim ideas about the role of women in society, and so each of my four wives will be required to wear the Hijab.

Professionally, I'll carve out a niche for myself in the American media landscape as the 'White Muslim.' I'll be a regular on the O'Reilly Factor, where my most oft used phrases will be "Bill, those aren't real Muslims!," and "That is not true Islam, Bill and you know it!"

Using this brilliant line that 'You can worship both Jesus and Allah,' I'll start a foundation that will eventually be responsible for converting millions of American and other Western Christians to Islam. 

Before I die, I'll see Islam become the number 1 religion in America, and hundreds of mosques will be named after me.

"My friend, so what do you think? Do you want to come in the van to our school with us?"

"Let's go."
