The dolmuş pulls over onto the shoulder of the highway 6km east of Urfa. The driver looks at me, and pointing out his window to the north says "Göbekli Tepe." I jump out.

After crossing the highway I stop at the beginning of a gravel road, in front of a brown sign that says "Göbekli Tepe 12." I already know that there aren't any dolmuş going up this road into the high hills. It's 4:30 in the afternoon and around 95 degrees as I start walking.

When I hear cars coming up behind me, I put out my thumb. The first 5 cars pass me by, but within 10 minutes I'm in the backseat of a small white delivery van, climbing higher into the golden, grass and shrub covered hills. The driver offers me a cigarette, which I decline, but no words are spoken on this ride.

I have read a lot about the site I am on my way to visit, and as I ride into the hills, on my way to finally seeing it, some of these stories float through my mind. My favorite may be Klaus Schmidt, a German archaeologist, discovering Göbekli Tepe in 1994. He has said in several interviews that within 1 minute of seeing the site for the first time he understood its importance, and realized he had two choices: “go away and tell nobody, or spend the rest of my life working here." 

Schmidt knew that the important work would consume him, and he thought very deeply about whether or not he wanted to be consumed. In the end, he decided to stay. Schmidt bought a house nearby in Urfa, married a Turkish archaeologist, and spent 20 years uncovering the secrets of Göbekli Tepe. He died three weeks ago.

After 10 minutes of silence, the delivery van driver pulls over at a fork in the road, in front of a large sign that says "Göbekli Tepe 4." He indicates that he is not going that way, so I jump out, say thank you, and start walking again. 

We might have climbed 1500 feet in that short drive, and the views are becoming very interesting. After 2 km of walking, my shirt is wet, and I am working very hard as I constantly climb higher into the hills. There are a couple of more hours of sunlight left, and I'm starting to think about how I'm going to get back to Urfa once I actually reach the site. In 20 minutes I haven't seen a single car. 

I could have hired a taxi to take me from Urfa to the site, wait 1 hour, and then take me back for about $60, but that would have been an expensive trip. To put that amount of money in perspective, it is what I spend on 4 nights “hotel” accommodation. But right now a sliver of doubt creeps in, and I wonder if trying to get to the site and back for just a couple of dollars was the best plan. Pushing those doubts - and my fatigue - aside, I keep walking; at this point, nothing is going to stop me from reaching the world’s oldest temple. 

As I walk, I remember that less than two weeks ago I was inside of one of Christianity’s oldest temples, and possibly its oldest, at the cave church of Peter in Antioch, near the Syrian border. It was during my struggle to get inside that ancient cave that I first began to feel like I was truly a pilgrim in the holy land, following thousands of years of tradition and other pilgrims. 

On this walk, I’m starting to feel the breadth and scope of my pilgrimage increase. I realize that I am journeying not just to important places in the history of Christianity, but to the most important places in the history of religion and of man’s search for meaning. I am a spiritual pilgrim, and I am sweating towards the oldest house of worship ever discovered, one that predates the earliest Christian temples by at least 9,000 years. 

I hear a beautiful sound behind me: tires on a gravel road. A small white car stops and I jump in, elated. He carries me the remaining two kilometers to the base of the dig, and I hike up to entrance. I pay 5 Turkish Lira to enter the site, and walk along a wooden boardwalk to the exposed temples. They are covered by a large wooden awning, and the elevated boardwalk runs through the middle of the site, protecting the ancient temples, but also creating a feeling of separation. 

What I am looking at are 4 circular installations, some almost 30 meters across, featuring large carved limestone megaliths weighing up to 50 tons each. The carvings on the stones are hard to make out from the walkway, but I’ve read that the bas-reliefs on the stones are of animals such as lions, foxes, boars, vultures, scorpions, spiders, and snakes. One of the boar apparently has a huge, erect penis. I think to myself: of course it does.

As I stare at these huge megaliths, I think about what makes this site so extraordinary: the fact that it was built by neolithic hunter-gatherers. Stone Age people. As another writer has written, “The idea of a religious monument built by hunter-gatherers contradicts most of what we thought we knew about religious monuments and about hunter-gatherers.” 

Before the discovery of Göbekli Tepe, it was widely believed that man’s invention of agriculture is what created for man the opportunity to create complex societies, religions, and then temples. But Schmidt thought that his findings here showed that we have the story backwards. He believed that it was actually man’s search for meaning, manifested in the need to build a sacred worship site, that forced hunter gatherers to invent agriculture. "First the temple, then the city," Schmidt said.

I exit the covered excavation area and walk towards the summit of the site, and stand beneath a beautiful mulberry tree, which sits atop some very old Byzantine and Ottoman graves at the very top. What a fantastic place to be buried, I think to myself. All around the immediate hill of the site I see olive and fruit trees, and the view is spectacular, and much grander than I had imagined. Schmidt explained the placement well: “Temples like to be on high sites...sanctuaries like to be away from the mundane world."

From the tree, at an elevation of about 2,500 feet, I can see Karacadag to the Northeast, the Taurus mountains to the North, the fertile Harran plane to the South, and to the Southwest I can see the edge of the Muslim pilgrimage city of Urfa. Some of the earliest human civilizations started in places I can see right now. I feel like I’m looking back in time. I also feel a bit like I am there.

In his writings and interviews, Schmidt speculated that nomadic bands of hunters from possibly hundreds of miles away, and in all the places I can see from this summit, were gathering here for rituals, feasting, and initiation rites before they ever started building the temples. Schmidt believe that during these gatherings they were having big Neolithic parties, possibly drinking beer, and possibly using “some kind of drugs.” 

Over time, they began building the incredible temples located below where I’m standing now. Schimdt’s theory is that the need to build this sacred site is what led the hunter-gatherers to first organize themselves as a large workforce, to then spend long periods of time here, and then to invent a stable food supply (agriculture) so that they could stay here.

Standing on the summit, in the late afternoon, I am thinking about all the things I’ve read and learned about this site, and all that I’ve seen today. I begin to ask myself if we have really come all that far in the last 12,000 years. If - despite all of our scientific progress - we any closer than the hunter-gatherers who built this site to answering the really big existential questions about what it means to enter, exist in, and then exit this world.

And then, standing underneath the mulberry tree, with a gentle breeze blowing across my face, I just close my eyes. I begin to feel deeply connected to the people who gathered here 12,000 years ago, and understand with perfect clarity that I am standing where I am now for the same reasons that they stood here. In this moment, I realize how short 12,000 years is, and how much shorter a single lifespan. The feeling is overwhelming; it is (and I am) transcendent, and I want hold on to this feeling for as long as I can. 

But after some time has passed I begin to lose the feeling, and opening my eyes, I realize that tears are now falling down my face. 

Two days later tears will again fall down my face. 

I will arrive at Mt Nemrut, 100 miles north of Göbekli Tepe, at 4 in the morning. Underneath a canopy of thousands of visible stars, I will make an easy hike up to the western terrace of Nemrut, and along the way I will see half a dozen shooting stars without even looking for them. 

Sitting down on a rock outcropping, I will already be able to tell that the view, 2,100 meters above the surrounding plains, is very special. “Temples like to be on high sites...sanctuaries like to be away from the mundane world." 

Over the next hour and a half I'll watch night slowly and subtly give way to light, and then finally, in ideal atmospheric conditions I will see the sun begin to appear above the horizon. I'll watch it clear the horizon as a small pink ball, turn purple as it expands and rises, and then much too quickly become a blazing ball of fire, too bright too look at. 

Too bright and brilliant to look at.

Turning away from the flame, I will feel the tears on my face, and will ask myself:

Does it make sense that a sunrise has the power to bring me to tears?

After a moment I will hear an answer: If the sun doesn't rise, you don’t exist. It all makes perfect sense. 

The ancients were wise to worship the sun, I will tell myself later. 

I will be left with some small insight into how moved sun worship cultures may have been by watching the sun rise. By watching their God rise.

Now, standing on the summit of Göbekli Tepe, I'm also thinking about the sun. It is getting very low, and while watching it disappear below the horizon from where I'm standing would be magical, I do not want to get stranded out here. I can see three cars in the parking lot below the site, and I desperately need one of them to give me a lift.

Wiping the tears from my face, I reluctantly begin my descent from this spiritual height, and my focus slowly begins to shift back towards my immediate and practical concerns. Back down on the gravel road I see the sun set, and shortly afterwards the summit of Göbekli Tepe disappears from view behind another hill.

A car pulls over, I jump in the back seat, and we speed down the mountain, back to the fertile plain below.
