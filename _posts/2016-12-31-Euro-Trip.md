On a bus ride from Macedonia to Serbia I made a new friend. 

Sadda is from Somalia, and he is spending the summer backpacking through Europe with 12 of his friends.  

So far they have done the Greek islands, Athens, Macedonia, and now Serbia -- Euro Trip, having a blast.

Sadda’s trip started last year in Somalia. His city of Mogadishu was and is divided into sections controlled by the Somali government and sections controlled by Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen, a jihadist terrorist group. The conflict has reached a kind of stalemate where the division has become somewhat normalized. There are checkpoints to go from one side to the other: Government troops on the government side, Al-Shabaab on the other.  

Sadda worked on the government side of town but his parents lived on the side controlled by Al Shabaab. One day he went through a checkpoint to visit his parents, and when he returned to the rebel side several days later he was detained by Al-Shabaab and taken to one of their prisons. 

He was accused of being a spy and was questioned for several days by armed Al-Shabaab members. With a gun pointed at him he was asked whether he wanted to live or die, and he was told that his answers to the questions he was going to be asked would determine the outcome.

His interrogators tortured him by beating him with a whip, hanging him up on a wall with chains, and repeatedly pouring cold water on him. They didn’t kill him, but instead put him in a jail with other suspected government spies. He spent six months in the jail, and was then released. A condition of his release was that he had to go back to the government side and gather information on the location of troops, troop movements, and other information of military and political value. It seemed that the point of his capture, torture, interrogation and detainment was actually to turn him into an Al-Shabaab spy. 

When he returned to the government side, he decided that he had no choice but to leave Somalia. He knew a few friends that he had grown up with you were living in Cairo, Eqypt and he decided to go meet them. Sadda and two other friends packed a bag with food and water and started walking. 

The distance from Mogadishu to Cairo is almost 5,000 kilometers. To get to Cairo the three friends had to walk through some of the most dangerous countries in the world. The walked out and across war torn Somalia, through countless military and Al-Shabaab checkpoints, and then crossed through the desert into Ethiopia one night. They walked across Ethiopia and then crossed into Sudan.

None of the 3 possessed passports or internationally recognized travel documents, and even if they did, they would not have been allowed to enter any of the countries they were traveling across. 

They walked 16 hours a day and at night they would find a secluded spot and lie down on their mats to sleep. Occasionally they were able to hitch rides, but they faced the constant threat of robbery and death at the hands of fighters, thieves, and police. Every day they would try to find some food to eat and some water to drink.

After a couple of weeks walking across Sudan they came near the Egyptian border. One night they walked into the desert and crossed the invisible border into Egypt. 

Once inside Egypt they walked through the desert until they reached a small city. They bought bus tickets to Cairo, and when they arrived in Cairo they contacted their Somali friends. The friends let them stay with them in their very crowded apartment in a poor part of Cairo. Sadda was happy to finally have a place to stay and some peace, but life in Egypt was not what he thought it was going to be. 

The Egyptians were deeply resentful of foreigners seeking refuge in their country. During his second day in Cairo Sadda was walking down a street when a group of Egyptians started calling him by a slang name they use for Somalians. Sadda walked towards the group and when he got close they attacked him. They beat him all over his body and took the small amount of money he had on him. 

Over the next three months he was attacked 9 times in Cairo. Twice he reported the incidents to the police, but the police simply asked him to show them his travel documents. When he couldn’t produce his travel documents the police told him that he should go back to his country. HIs friends’ apartment in Cairo became a kind of jail for Sadda. He could not go outside unless with a group of friends, and then only during busy daylight hours and only to a small section of the neighborhood. He did not have any money and was forced to rely on the generosity of his friends. 

Sadda had a friend who had made the dangerous trip to Europe, and Sadda spoke to him on Skype from an internet cafe. His friend had been living in Denmark for a year and told Sadda how great his life was. Sadda had trouble even believing much of what his friend told him about life in Europe. Sadda’s friend told him that he could connect Sadda with the man in Cairo who had helped him get to Europe, but the price was high: $1,500. 

Once Sadda made up his mind to go to Europe, his friends rallied to help. Somali friends and friends of friends from around the world chipped in to loan Sadda the money to make the trip. Once Sadda had the money, he went with friends to meet the Egyptian connection. They gave the Egyptian the $1,500, Sadda thanked his friends for their help, and then said goodbye. He did not know if he would ever see them again.

The Egyptian drove Sadda north to Alexandria with 3 other Somalis. They arrived in Alexandria, a port city on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast after a four hour drive. The Egyptian took Sadda and the other 3 men to a small apartment where a dozen people were already living and waiting.

If anyone had a cellphone, it was taken from them by the Egyptians. They were told that they were not allowed to leave the apartment or to make noise other than quiet talking. Several Egyptians guarded them at all times. They stayed in the apartment in Alexandria for a week, and then suddenly they were told that they were leaving. 

In the early morning they were led downstairs in groups of 2 or 3 to waiting cars and then driven out of Alexandria. They drove along the coast for a couple of hours until they arrived at a chicken farm. They were led through a field into an outdoor cellar where they were locked inside with a group of around 20 people. 

They were not allowed to talk or make any noise. Anyone who broke the rule was brutally beaten by their Egyptian guards to set an example. They stayed in the dirt floor cellar for 6 days. The Egyptians would pass them bread each day and a few bottles of water. They went went to the bathroom in a corner of the basement. The smell of their own piss and excrement was unpleasant, but not as bad as the smell of the thousands of nearby chickens. 

Around 3am on the 6th day in the basement the Egyptians told them they were leaving. They moved silently into a van for a short drive to a beach. At the beach they loaded into 2 small boats and then began motoring out to sea in the darkness. Everyone was silent. Sadda was afraid because he could not swim, and the boat seemed very unstable. As the boat churned through the sea salt water sprayed on them.

After an hour, the boat slowed down and the came upon another larger boat. Sadda could see that it was already crowded with many people. 

They motored alongside and each climbed over into the larger boat. More small boats arrived and offloaded more people. Every time Sadda thought that it would not be possible for any more people to fit inside of the boat, more people would arrive. 

As the first light of the morning began to appear, the engine of the boat began to roar and they started to move. There was not enough room in the boat for everyone to sit down at the same time, so they took turns sitting and standing. Their destination, they were told, was Italy. 

The trip across the Mediterranean from Alexandria to the closest point of Italy is roughly 1,000 nautical miles. At a speed of 8 knots, which would be fast for such an overloaded and underpowered boat, it is a 6 day journey. Sadda’s description of the vessel makes me believe it was an open fishing boat, perhaps 20 or 30 meters long, that had been stripped of all fixtures to allow it to fit as many people as possible. The boat was never intended to carry passengers, and could probably safely accommodate 20 people.

The Egyptians had loaded 264 people into the boat. At $1,500 per person they had collected about $400,000 from the passengers, and they were intent on maximizing their profit. There were no life jackets, no food, and no water. The boat was never intended to come back; it was on a one way trip. 

The two drivers of the boat were Syrian refugees fleeing Syria. 3 days before the group left, the Egyptians had chosen the men to be drivers because they spoke Arabic and could communicate with the Egyptians. The Egyptians took the Syrians to the boat and trained them on how to start the engine, how to steer the boat, and how to operate the cell phone and radio that they were going to be given. 

The plan, they were told, was to drive the boat as close to Italy as possible and then to send SOS messages seeking assistance from the Italian Coast Guard. The Syrians were given a document with instructions on what to say to the authorities in English and Italian, and included among the instructions was the fact that there were 264 people aboard the vessel without food or water.

The boat did not have a navigational compass. Somehow the Egyptians could track the location of the boat from their base in Egypt. Every couple of hours the Egyptians would call the Syrians on the phone they were given with instructions such as “steer a little more to the right” or “steer a little more to the left.” 

Without any cover above them, the sun was harsh and most of the people aboard were often violently seasick. Very few of them could swim. In their minds were stories of the sinking of boats like theirs, including the infamous death of 700 refugees in the sinking of a single ship trying to reach Italy a couple of months earlier. It would not take much for the overloaded and unstable boat to capsize and sink, sending them all to their deaths. On day four, some people began to drink sea water. Others became delirious and began hallucinating. 

On the 5th day the boat ran out of fuel. When the Egyptians called, the Syrians informed the Egyptians of their predicament, and the Egyptians said it was now time to call for help. 

The Syrians began using the radio, sending the distress messages per the instructions they were given, and they heard from someone. But for 12 hours nothing happened and they lost contact with the people they had been talking to. Some of the Sudanese began fighting the Syrians blaming them for leading them out into the ocean without enough fuel to die of dehydration. The Syrians responded that they were just refugees like everyone else and that they had no choice in the matter. 

This was the darkest hour of Sadda’s life. He was sure that he was going to die, and he wished that he had never left Somalia. He felt that the idea to leave his country and embark on this journey was foolish and he only blamed himself for having taken such risks with his life. He began to pray that his death would not be painful. 

But then on the 6th day a cargo ship was sighted. It was bearing down on the boat and came closer and closer until it only narrowly avoided smashing into them. They large container ship turned around and came near enough to communicate with them by shouting. The sailors asked them what they were doing, and they responded that they were trying to get to Italy, but had no fuel, water, or food. The sailors began throwing food and water down to the boat, but those in the boat began fighting each other for the aid and the boat became dangerously unstable. The Albanian crew told them to be calm, and that there would be enough for everyone. 

After several hours the Albanians told the refugees that they would be bringing them aboard the ship. They were closest to Greek waters, and the Albanians had communicated with Greek authorities who authorized them to bring the refugees to a nearby Greek island. A Jacob’s Ladder was lowered down, and one by one they climbed up the the ladder to the steel deck of the cargo ship. Arriving on the deck of that ship was the happiest moment of Sadda’s life. He had been saved from what seemed a certain death.

The mood was jubilant. After eating and drinking water the people laid down on the bare steel decks and went to sleep. 12 hours later they arrived off of a Greek island and climbed down the ladder into launch boats that took them to a refugee center. The Red Cross was waiting for them. They were fed and given tents to sleep in. Because everyone on the boat was from war torn countries such as Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Iraq, they could not be repatriated against the will. 

The Red Cross held meetings where they told the refugees about life in Europe and about different ways refugees had received asylum. The Red Cross also gave them pamphlets full of information about different ways they could seek assistance in finding a new home. 

The Greeks fingerprinted everyone and took their pictures. Then they gave them a document, printed on an ordinary piece of printer paper and written in Greek. Stapled to the paper was the picture they had taken, and the document was impressed with a blue stamp, also in Greek. It would be impossible for anyone who could not read Greek to understand what the document said. 

They were told that this document allowed them to stay in Greece for 6 months, but gave them no rights to work in Greece. After 3 days in the camp they were told they had to leave. They walked out of the camp where local police from the island were waiting. The police told them that they were not allowed to stay on the island and must leave immediately. The police drove them in groups to the ferry terminal and told them that they must buy and ticket to Athens and leave on the next boat.

They were now on their own. In the camp Sadda and 12 other Somalis had decided to form a group and to stay together to help each other. On the ferry Sadda struck up a conversation with a Greek man. He told the man his story and told him that they had very little money and knew nothing about Greece or Athens. They thought they were going to end up in Italy. The Greek told them that he knew a place in Athens where Africans hung out in a park, and maybe these people could help them. 

When they arrived in Athens the man helped the group navigate the subway system and then led them to the park. Luckily there were Somalis in the park. A Somali man told them that he had an apartment where they could all stay. He charged them 10 Euros each and said they could stay indefinitely. There were about 20 people in the small apartment. They pooled money together to buy food that they cooked in the apartment and ate as a group. They slept on the floor wherever they could find a spot. 

Sadda had never in his life felt as free as he did in Athens. His country had been at war for the entire 25 years of his life. Even in Egypt he was hated and then became a prisoner in an apartment that was not his. But in Athens he could walk wherever he wanted. He even went out walking at midnight. He really enjoyed walking around the city at night. It was a new and exciting experience. 

But the group quickly decided that Greece was not the place to stay. They had no permanent status, and the government, which was dealing with its own crisis, could offer them no aid. After two weeks the group decided to leave Greece and head north. They walked out of the apartment, and then kept walking. They walked for 10 days, sometimes along the side of busy highways, until the reached the border of Macedonia. They became used to people staring at them. At night they would sleep wherever they could find a place to lay down the sleeping bags that the Red Cross had given them. 

At the Macedonian border they waited two days, sleeping outside, until the Macedonians granted them documents that gave them 72 hours to transit through Macedonia. They walked through Macedonia. On a steep gravel road one member of the group, a 20 year old man, slipped and injured his leg. At a pharmacy in a nearby town sympathetic staff helped him bandage the wound and gave him a brace and a crutch to help him walk.

They continued the journey, sometimes taking buses, and sometimes walking. Sometimes people would give them food or money, and they would try to negotiate a room where they could all crowd in to get some sleep out of the weather. 

When they reached the Serbian border they again waited two days, and were again granted a 72 hour pass. When my bus from Macedonia crossed the Serbian border, we stopped in a small town and I saw the group getting on board. They began to find seats randomly, but the bus driver began sternly moving all of them to the back of the bus. When he had them all seated in the back, he whispered to me that I could now move up to the front to get away from them. I thanked him, but said I was ok.

Sadda and I talked for several hours on the long ride to Belgrade. I asked him about the way that the bus driver had treated them, but he did not understand that anything unusual had happened. I let it go. 

I asked Sadda what he wanted to do with his life and he said, “You are going to think I’m crazy when I tell you this, but I want to go to a university and study International Relations. That’s my dream. And then I want to help people like us.”

I told him that I did not think he was crazy at all, and that I was sure that he would figure out how to get the education that he wanted. I said, you speak three languages, and what you have already accomplished is much more difficult than going to school. He smiled.

Sadda does not know they are going or what is going to happen to them. He does not know what country will give them a permanent status or how they are going to get through the next day, but he is very optimistic. They just live day to day, and stay grateful that they are so far along the journey.

We got off the bus in Belgrade in the late evening. I wanted to help them find a place to stay, but I had to solve the same problem for myself, and that was going to be hard enough. I was also pretty sure they could figure it out. I gave Sadda 50 Euros and wished him the best of luck. 

As I was walking away I looked back at the group. They were in a circle, taking turns talking, trying to figure out their next move.
