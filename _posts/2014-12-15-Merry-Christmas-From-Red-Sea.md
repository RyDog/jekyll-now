Merry Christmas from the Red Sea!  
Last night we celebrated a traditional Christmas at Sea.  

The Steward’s department prepared a delicious turkey dinner with all the fixins, which the crew devoured and then for dessert we had apple pie! 

Things got a little crazy when the crew gathered in the Officer’s Saloon and the Captain broke out the nonalcoholic Sparkling Cider: For half an hour toasts were made, a few carols were sung and Christmas cheer was spread all round.

The Chief Mate emerged dressed as Santa Claus and passed out presents - one large bow-topped present to each crew member - while making a long string of jokes and threats centered around the theme that he was a very naughty, sexually predatory, and gay Santa. 

The men nervously accepted their gifts from Santa and then excitedly tore into their packages, but the initial excitement quickly faded when each man found only a pair of socks and a tube of toothpaste inside.

The gift actually made the men feel sad, so the party began to break up. Men began to retire alone to their staterooms to lie in their bunks and watch pornographic films on their laptops or phones for several hours.

In their rooms, some of the men began to feel so sad and lonesome that they started to cry while alternately watching porno and looking at pictures of their families back home. 

But, some of the men thought about their families back home and become so happy that they decided to take an extra sleeping pill to celebrate the fact that they don’t have to deal with their families again this year at the holidays. “Sorry, can’t make it. I’m on a ship! Hahaha,” they thought to themselves.

Eventually, everyone dozed off into a porn, turkey, swell, and pharmacological (or sadness) induced slumber. 

Just kidding, Just kidding. There was no apple pie! It was pumpkin, again!

Hey, but seriously, seriously, Merry Christmas from the Red Sea everyone, and especially my family. 

I miss and love you all!
