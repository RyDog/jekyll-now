title: Free Camping Outside of Nederland Colorado

i'm free camping at 9000 feet in the national forest 5 miles outside of the small mountain town of Nederland, Colorado. 
It's beautiful. I am alone out there. Except yesterday while I was sleeping some people started firing guns. And they kept firing for the next few hours. When they stopped I shat in the woods and afterwards made a fire.

Today I drove down into town to get beers and food, and I was sitting at this place eating a sandwich when I heard a window break, then I heard dogs fighting and people screaming. 
I jumped up and the whole town was getting involved. 
Two dogs had been locked inside of a burgundy Volvo station wagon when this big fluffy white dog came walking by, tethered to a leash held by his momma. 
the dogs inside the car wanted a piece, so they smashed through the passenger side window of the Volvo and attached the big fluffy dog. 

Do you know how hard it is to break a passenger window? 
These dogs wanted out. People were kicking the huskies to get them off of fluffy, children were screaming and then crying, the owner of fluffy dropped her iPhone on the street, shattering the screen, and a drunk lady on a picnic table in a grass parking lot kept yelling "don't leave your fucking dogs in your car! I'm tired of this!"
I went over to the Pioneer Inn to have a beer with some wifi. 

I'm drinking a bottle of Original Coors Banquet Beer and they have the grateful dead playing on the sound system and Monday Night Football on the tellyvision. 
A guy on the other side of the bar just made the claim to everyone else at the bar that he's the only person to ever attend a Grateful Dead concert in the Marine Corps Dress Blues Uniform. 
The song that's playing is "Fire on the Mountain." 

Do you know the chorus?
