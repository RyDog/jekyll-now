title: If You Go To Cappadocia
---
If you go to Cappadocia, sleep in a cave. You can do it for the price of a 6 pack of microbrew back home. People here have been carving cave houses out of the soft rock and sleeping in them for at least 3500 years. As you are falling asleep, think about how you are connected to them. 

If you have the money, rent a dirt bike. If you are short of money, rent a scooter. The guy renting it to you will tell you to bring it back full of petrol, and he’ll warn you that you can’t take the Chinese-made, 125cc machine offroad -- into the valleys between the many mountains in the area. But he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Do bring it back full of petrol, though.

Head out on your machine, and go visit an underground city. Located on the boundary of various rival empires, the people here dug entire cities underground, through the soft rock. Some of the cities are eight stories deep. When invaders would attack, they took refuge underground. 

Don’t rush. Find a room near the bottom of the city and just sit down. Watch the other tourists file past. Imagine living down here. Imagine dying down here. Imagine bands of savage killers galloping towards you, intent on massacring you and your family and everyone else underground. When you feel grateful for what you have, for the life you live, you are ready to leave.

Watch out for groups tours. 

Visit the vast monastic complex known as the Goreme Open Air Museum. The site and the region served as a religious refuge to early days of Christianity, and large monastic communities were established here. The monks began painting Byzantine frescoes in the cave chapels in the seventh century. Many still remain. The frescoes in the Dark Church (carved from the rock) are from the 11th century, are truly impressive. Take pictures, even though you aren’t supposed to. Make one of them your computer’s background image.

Pick a random valley on your map and head in that direction. The only other vehicles you might see in a 10km stretch are a couple of tractors. Feel like you are living in a movie. It feels good. When you see an unmarked dirt path heading into valley, just take it. These paths are everywhere. Ride past small vineyards, deserted cave houses, pigeon holes, and fairy chimneys. The landscape is breathtaking, and distracting. Stay focused. Remember, you’re on a Chinese scooter. The fairy chimneys are especially impressive and distracting: tall and thin rock spires, they consist of soft rock topped by harder, less easily eroded rock. Penis Rocks would be a more accurate descriptive name.

You aren’t expecting to meet any people out here. As you go deeper into the valley, and taking various forks in the paths, you might start imagining worst case scenarios...try to push those out of your mind. And make sure you brought several liters of water with you. 

You aren’t expecting to meet any people out here...but you might. You might get to the bottom of a steep and narrow rock incline and find the path is no longer passable, and when you look up see a woman making pottery under a canopy. Go talk to her, and she might tell you this story: She is Dutch, but has been living in Turkey for 11 years, and she now lives here in “the valley” with her Turkish partner. He could be nearby carving a jewelry box and applying a lacquer he made from the shells of walnuts. She’ll tell you that they live here, in a cave house, out in the valley. They are artists, and they spend their time creating art, and enjoying life. Every week or two they make a trip into town to sell their art, get supplies, and reconnect. But they always come back here. 

They might invite you to look around their setup, and to climb up to the top of their rock, 100 meters above their workshop. Up there you will see a most incredible 360 degree view of the valley. You’ll see the table and chairs they have set up, and their fire pit. You’ll imagine what the stars look like at night, and you’ll return two hours later to watch the sunset with them...and your mind will be blown. And you’ll probably want to live here.

But before you watch that sunset with them, leave your scooter at their place and walk 500 yards farther down the valley. You’ll come upon a “cafe” and the lone man operating the cafe will be be selling fresh orange juice. Buy some. The oranges have been stored underground for a year in a cold (or so he’ll tell you). If he invites you to sit down and chill, do it. If he offers you a shot of whiskey, take it. If takes out a measure of Turkish tobacco, scrapes piles of homemade Turkish hashish on it, rolls it into a large spliff, and then offers to share it with you -- do what your heart tells you to do.

If, shortly thereafter, this man - who has lived in a remote valley by himself for the last 8 years - asks you in broken English, apropos of nothing (or everything), if you believe in God --- don’t answer right away. 

Stare up at the huge fairy chimneys that surround you...look at the way the sunlight breaks through in places and illuminates a huge and completely improbable tree. Think about everything that you saw today, and about the amazing sunset that you are anticipating in a short while. Close your eyes and take a deep breath, hold it...let it out. 

Then, tell him the truth.
