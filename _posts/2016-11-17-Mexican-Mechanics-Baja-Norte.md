How would you approach dealing with a #mechanic in a small town in #mexico if you were alone and equipped with a very limited command of the Spanish language? 
I'll tell you what you should do: act very #confident. 
Act like you go to little #Taller #Mechanico places all the time. 
Say "Cu√°nto cuesta?" before any work gets done, and then write the number down on a piece of paper and show it to the nice mechanico. 
Then when he starts working you hang around and act interested, like you know exactly what's going on under the hood or beneath the vehicle. 
Fortunately, i don't have to do that, because I know what's going on with my race car. 
And this guy was great. 
Very friendly, competent and honest, unlike the mechanic in San Diego who, after rotating and balancing my tires, told me that my rear brake cylinders were leaking brake fluid and that the "brake pedal could go to the floor at any time and then you won't be able to stop and you'll die! But we can fix it for $350." 
I suspected he was either lying or incompetent, and it turns out that what he told me was indeed a crock of california horseshit. 
My man here in mexico took the wheels off, we inspected the rear brake cylinders and there was no sign of fluid leaking from either cylinder. 
So he cleaned everything off, did a couple of other little repairs i've been meaning to get done, changed the motor oil and filter and charged me $35 for everything. 
I love Mexico.
