“You know what would would be a good way to make a lot of money?,” the Mate asked aloud to the only other person on the ship’s bridge. “Take over this Strait and make every ship that passes through it pay you a fee - a tax. That would be a good business. What do you think? You think I’m the first person who ever thought of that idea?”

The Lookout was slumped sideways against the bridge’s starboard bulkhead, staring blankly through his dark, wraparound sunglasses over the containers on the deck, past the bow of the ship and off into the thick haze shrouding the Strait of Hormuz.

“Nooooo, you’re probably not the first person who ever thought a’ that there Mate,” the Lookout replied, disinterestedly, and without moving moving his head or his body. 

“30% of the world’s oil passes through this Strait every year,” the Mate continued. “Think about how much money that is. When we went through the Suez Canal last week we got the sh*t taxed out of us, you know that? It costs the company over $300,000 to send this ship through the Suez. I read that 40 ships a day transit that canal on a average day, so that’s 12…say 12 million dollars every day in tax the Egyptians are collecting. Billions of dollars every year. Billions.

“H*ll, look at what we did in Panama. We created that country so we could finish the canal and then we taxed anyone that wanted to use it for the next 75 years. That’s what the French and British did in Egypt too. If it wasn’t for the U.S. Navy Iran would probably be taxing every ship that tried to use this Strait today. Think about it. It’s the white man. He’s always trying to control the maritime chokepoints and collect the tax or to patrol the chokepoints to avoid the tax. Control or Patrol. Yep. Look at what’s happening off of Somalia. These pirates are just guys trying to impose a tax on ships transiting their waters. That’s why we have to have these Navy seals onboard. That’s why we have military bases in the Horn of Africa now. Chokepoint Taxes.“

The Lookout did not say anything in response, and as usual the Mate was not sure if he was even awake behind his glasses. The Mate once overheard the Lookout brag that he had a Gift - he had actually called it a Gift - which was that he could at any time “Space-Out” into “Deep Thought” while staring out at the sea. The Lookout had explained that he considered this ability a Gift because, in his Deep Space-Out, time and subsequently the sea watches moved by very quickly. 

The Mate presumed that there was a very fine line between his Lookout being in his gifted Deep Space-Out state and simply being asleep, and he therefore never presumed that the Lookout was awake - unless the Lookout was talking. The Lookout seemed to have two states: the catatonic Deep Space-Out and then something bordering on mania. When he was manic, which was anytime that he had more than 1 cup of coffee, he seemed incapable of not talking. 

The Mate picked up one of the cheap pairs of binoculars near the forward bridge windows, and placed them to his eyes. As he did so he tried not to think about how many other eyes had been inside the rubber eye cups that day, or that week, or if the smell of the binoculars was the smell of his shipmates’ eyes. But he could not help himself to these thoughts. 

Scanning the sea ahead of the ship, he replayed in his mind some of the things that he had just said about Chokepoint Taxes and about the White Man, and then asked himself if he actually believed any of it. He wasn’t sure.

Through the binoculars the Mate saw several fishing boats ahead of the ship, and then focused on the stern of the large, empty supertanker, almost dead ahead, which the ship had been slowly overtaking for more than an hour. He noticed the tanker’s name, written in white block letters against the black hull: “NECTAR”

His own ship was steering a course of 329 degrees and approaching the entrance to the Strait’s Traffic Separation Scheme, designed to prevent collisions by creating separate 2 mile wide lanes for inbound and outbound ship traffic: lines on a chart, but very important lines on a chart. 

Now anticipating problems as his own ship and Nectar navigated the narrow shipping lane at very close range, the Mate decided to call Nectar on the VHF radio to arrange a safe passage. Picking up the radio handset and pressing the transmit button, the Mate said, “Nectar, Nectar, this is [Ship Name] calling on channel one six. Do you copy?”

About a brief delay came a reply, in an Indian accent with a hint of proper British: “Yes, [Ship Name], this is Nectar.”

“Nectar, can we please go to channel one two?”

“One Two.”

“Nectar, this is [Ship Name], uh, we are slowly overtaking you on your port side and want to make sure that we maintain a safe distance from you as we enter the separation lane.”

“Ok, I see you behind me [Ship Name] and I understand. We will move over to the right side of the inbound lane and you can safely overtake us on our port side.”

“Great, thank you very much Nectar. Have a Happy New Year and a safe watch. [Ship Name] standing by on one six.”

“A happy New Year to you as well, Sir. Nectar standing by one six.” 

The Lookout was impressed by the radio exchange and the results. 

“Hey Mate you’ve really got that down, man,” said the Lookout, coming to life. “Gettin' that big super tanker to move over for you, man you really know how to sweet talk ‘em!”

“Haa, maybe so. Maybe so,” the Mate replied. “But now I need you to come over here and put her in hand steering as we overtake the Nectar and get into this separation scheme.”

The Lookout pressed himself away from his spot on the bulkhead and then lumbered towards the steering stand and the ship’s wheel located at the center line of the bridge. 

“Going to hand steering,” said the Lookout when he arrived at the wheel. He toggled a switch above the wheel from the Autopilot position to the Helm position, and then suddenly the 1,000 foot ship and it’s 35 foot tall rudder, along with all of the ship’s cargo and crew members, were directly connected, through electronic relays and powerful mechanical machinery, to the mind of this seaman with the Deep Space-Out gift. 

“In Hand. Steering three, two, nine,” the Lookout noted. 

“Roger that. Please steer three, two, five,” said the Mate, slowing his speech to emphasize each individual number.

“Three, two, five, aye,” the Lookout replied, as he begin to apply a small amount of left rudder to bring the ship over.

When the Lookout had steadied the ship on a course of 325 degrees, he said “Steady on three, two, five,” and the Mate acknowledged him. The stern of the Nectar was now on the ship’s starboard side, and the bearing of the Nectar relative to the ship was increasing to starboard as the ship continued to slowly overtake the Nectar. 

The Master’s Standing Orders stated that the ship to be steered by hand at all times when overtaking other vessels at close range, which the ship was now doing, so the Lookout would be on the wheel steering in hand for more than an hour.

“Hey Mate, like I said, I really like the way you talk to people on the radio. The mate I spent 5 months with last year was a totally different guy let me tell ya'. He was the rudest, meanest person I’ve ever heard use the radio. He would just yell at anyone and threaten people and just go crazy on the radio for no reason at all. I would actually feel embarrassed for the ship and personally embarrassed many times even though I knew that they had no idea who I was. Man, that’s how bad it was. I think the guy had serious issues.”

“What was his deal? Why do you think he acted like that?”

“Man, I don’t know. Our ship was only 450 feet long, but if a 1,200 foot super tanker was asking us to move over a little so they could overtake us he would get on the air and yell and scream at them and just refuse to move. He would make fun of their accents and the country that he thought they were from, stuff like that. He had been on the ship for 10 months and had problems with his wife and kids and was into a lot of different conspiracy theories, too. He would make me go stand on the bridge wing for the whole watch sometimes. He was a short guy too. I’m not sure if that had anything to do with it.”

“How tall was he?”

“He was pretty short. Probably about 5’ 2”

“But on the radio he was 400 feet long!”

“Ha ha, yeah that’s true. Very true Mate. Yeah, now that I think of it, his height probably had something to do with the way he would talk to people on the radio. It probably did.”

“What kind of conspiracy theories was he into?”

“Well, lots of stuff about the government. I don’t follow politics but he talked about the government a lot. And he never really came out and said it but I think he was into the whole White Power thing too.”

“White Power, really? What made you think he was into White Power?”

“Well, being a biker and being from the Poconos I have friends that are into the White Power thing. And it was just that a lot of the things he would talk about sounded like the stuff the White Power guys talk about. Like my friend Danny V back home, he’s got a swastika flag up in his basement and he has Mein Kampf and all that sh*t. Man I had never heard of Mein Kampf until Danny V gave me a copy one day and told me to read it. I read a couple pages but I’m not into that sh*t. F***ing Hitler? I mean, come on ya know?”

“Wow, that is crazy. Are these guys that you know in the KKK?”

“Well, they have meetings and stuff. It’s not the KKK but they have little militias or groups that meet, but it’s not as formal as the KKK I guess you would say. But my cousins, now they live down in Louisiana and that part of my family is involved in the Klan. But that’s a totally different thing. In the Poconos where we live there are almost no black people, but down in Louisiana there’s more black people than white people, so it’s a totally different thing.”

“Yeah, I can see how your proximity to your racial enemies could make a big difference in how you express your hatred towards them.”

“Yeah, definitely. Louisiana White Power guys are totally different than White Power guys in the Poconos. Totally different. Believe me on that one. But alright Mate, here’s a quick one.”

And while steering a large ship as it overtook another large ship 14 miles from the Iranian coast, the Lookout launched into his story.

“So my friend Danny V lives near me in the Poconos and he lives across the street from this guy Moses. Now Moses is from Africa, like he was born in Africa.”

“Where in Africa?,” the Mate interrupted. 

“Uhhh, you know, I have no idea. That’s a good question but I have no idea. But everyone always said he was from somewhere in Africa, but he’s definitely not from America you know. Real dark skinned guy. And Moses just sort of showed up in the Poconos, I really don’t know why he came there. Moses actually died last year, but he was the toughest, strongest dude I ever met. I sh*t you not, Mate. And I’ve met some tough dudes. He was about six six and probably 300 pounds of muscle. 

“He showed up in the Poconos when I was just out of high school I guess. He was the only black guy around and it was like he came from a different planet. And he would just roll up to a bar by himself and all these rednecks did not like this black guy, especially because he always had a young, white girlfriend. I don’t know how he did it, but he always had a good looking white girl. And guys would try to start sh*t with him, you know? But it didn’t take people long for people to learn not to f**k with Moses. One time he took on 5 guys in a bar and destroyed them. That fight became legendary around there. I’m telling you, Moses was a bad motherf***er. He earned people’s respect real quick.”

“So anyways, my friend Danny V lived across the street from Moses. And one day a couple years ago Moses is having a little cookout in his yard, maybe 7 or 8 people drinking beers and grilling hotdogs you know. And at this time Moses is about 70 years old, but of course he has like a 35 year old white girl living with him. God bless the guy. God bless the guy for that. But anyways, Danny V got up that morning and started drinking this malt liquor called Steel Reserve. This real strong beer you know, which Danny V didn’t normally drink. And Danny V gets real wasted and eventually he goes out into his yard and he’s stumbling around and he starts yelling to the people in Moses’ yard about how they shouldn’t be over there because they are hanging out with a um, you know he calls Moses a…a N***er. Just yelling the N word at Moses and his guests like 100 feet away. 

“So everyone is yelling at Danny V to shut the h**l up and go back in his house but he doesn’t, and Moses starts walking over there in his flip flops and he’s asking Danny V what he said and Danny V says it again. Well, that was a bad idea. Moses walks right up to Danny V and open-hand slaps him, but Mate, it was the hardest slap you’ve ever seen. Danny V goes flying back and lands on this big shrub and blood is flying everywhere and Moses is saying ‘Who’s a N****er now? Huh? Who’s a N****er now?’ And Moses is saying ‘Stay Down! Don’t get back up!’

“So everyone from the cookout is also yelling at Danny V to stay down, but he’s on this shrub and he’s holding on to it with his right arm and he bounces back up because the shrub like springs him back up when he pops back up Moses slaps him again. Pow! And he falls back again into the shrub, but he’s still holding on to this shrub and so it lifts him back upright again and he looks like one of those Bozo the Clown punching bags you know and he won’t let go of the shrub, so he goes down and pops back up and Moses slaps him again. Boom! Just brutal slaps to Danny’s face. And this happens 5 or 6 times until Danny V is knocked out and rolls off the shrub.”

“And Moses turns around and goes back to his own yard and cracks a beer you know. Like real cool. Well a couple people put Danny V in a car and rush him to the hospital. Danny V’s lost a couple of teeth and his face was all messed up, but he also broke his arm and tore some ligaments in his shoulder —because he wouldn’t let go of that shrub you know? Doing the Bozo the Clown thing…

“But Mate, that’s not even the end of the story. It gets worse for Danny V! He had this security guard job at this pharmaceutical plant nearby, but he has to go on disability because of his shoulder. Well, apparently he had made some, um, you know, racial comments to a guy he worked with, like mumbling stuff under his breath to this black guy he worked with, probably the N word you know. And so this guy had it out for Danny V. 

“Well, this guy happens to drive by Danny V’s house after this and Danny V is working on a car - he was actually helping his father change the brakes in his father’s car - but he’s supposed to be unable to work you know? So the guy drives by and sees this and he reports Danny V to his boss and the insurance people come by and see him working on a car and so Danny V ends up getting fired from his job for lying about not being able to work. 

“And so he can’t find another job because of the economy and he ends up not being able to pay his mortgage. And would you believe that he ended up losing his house and after the bank took it back he had to go move in move in with his brother. And as far as I know he is still living with his brother.

The Lookout paused to catch up on missed breaths, and to check the course he was steering, which was still dead-on three two five.

“But I’ll tell you what, Mate, Danny V never drank Steel Reserve again after that day. I know that for a fact. He learned his lesson on that one.”

And then the Mate said “Yeahhhhhhh, I bet he never called anyone a Ni**er to their face again, either.”
