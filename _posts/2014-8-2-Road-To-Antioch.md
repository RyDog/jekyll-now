title: The Road to Antioch

Today I’m leaving Cappadocia and heading to Antioch. 

It would be a better story if I was (or you were) traveling there in this van. I’m not, but let’s pretend.

Driving almost due South from Goreme, you cruise through the less scenic but still spectacular parts of Cappadocia, across the high Anatolian plateau of central Turkey. Or, we should say, what is presently called “Turkey.” If you’ve learned anything so far on your trip it’s that the current political boundaries, names, and even the dominant religion of this region won’t last long. 1,000 years would be a very, very good run. Modern Turkey isn’t yet 100 years old.

Small farms, vineyards and ranches that people have been working for thousands of years fly past you on both sides of the road. The people working the land do as well. The traffic is surprisingly light. If you ever smoke cigarettes, you’re definitely ripping a few on this drive.

Obviously the windows are down, and you’re definitely listening to music. Perhaps King of the Delta Blues Singers by Robert Johnson. Or a Woody Guthrie anthology? Both seem to fit the moment for some reason.

Your mind starts to wander back to things that you saw and experienced during your brief stay in Cappadocia. You try to piece together the things that you’ve learned about this region, its history and its culture into something linear, coherent, and concise that you can wrap your mind around.

You settle in to the drive, going on mental auto-pilot, and your mind starts to wander. You recall the small, two-room museum you wandered into in Ürgüp, attracted by the sign that read: “Museum Free.” The museum attendant was asleep in his chair, chin on his chest, but not so asleep that a soft cough didn’t wake him up. He turned on the lights for you, unlocked the door to the cage separating the small lobby from the other two rooms, and invited you in with a wave of his hand. Perhaps you were the first visitor of the day?

The first thing a visitor to this museum will see is a very large tusk in a rather flimsy glass case -- no climate control here. A faded black and white display card explains in a broken English translation that the tusk was found nearby, belonged to a Mammoth, and is approximately 10 million years old. 10 million years old. That’s the historical baseline for this little museum.

Next are some small stone Hittite artifacts. These bronze age people first appeared here around 3,000 years ago. An adjacent display case houses an incredible collection of coins, organized by date and period. Perhaps 300 coins in all. Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman. All of them feature the face of a ruler. Some things never change. Pieces of stunning 8th century christian frescoes sit next to two 11th century hand printed Korans. A pair of beautiful 2nd century AD carpets are tacked to the wall. 

Its 450 kilometers from Goreme to Antioch (Antakya). At 200 km south of Goreme you start to enter the Taurus mountain range that separates Cappadocia from Cilicia, the region of southeastern Turkey bordered by the Mediterranean sea. The road climbs into the mountains, and the van strains up the steep grades. 

It occurs to you that the little local museum has become the framework that you can use to explain Cappadocia to yourself. Layers and layers of history -waves of history, just overflowing. An incredible collection of artifacts and art in a little museum that, despite being free, seems to have very few visitors. But the story told in those two rooms is coherent and thorough enough. You can wrap your mind around it, at least.

Once you are through the mountains and on the other side of the Taurus range you will have left Cappadocia. It will be time to turn your attention back to the history of the early Christian movement -- retracing the steps of Paul, and the other early Christian missionaries and organizers.

It will be a short drive to Tarsus, birthplace of Paul, and worth a stop. There is a house there that claims to be Paul’s house, but it probably isn’t. In Tarsus you’ll turn left (east), and drive inland to Erzin, where you’ll turn south and drive along the coast of the Mediterranean, then inland to Antioch. You’ll be 12 miles from the Syrian border.

Antioch has been called the “cradle of Christianity,” and was a hugely important city in Christianity’s early development. Early Christianity was a Jewish movement, and Antioch’s large Jewish population attracted the earliest missionaries -- Jewish followers of Jesus who were preaching to other Jews. 

“Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.”
The Acts of the Apolstles 11:19 

Antioch is also where followers of Jesus were first called “Christians”:

“Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.”
The Acts of the Apostles 11:25-26

The big question you might be searching for here is “How did this Christianity thing get started?”
Or, how do you get from the earliest “Christians” in 1st Century Antioch, to a 21st century “Antioch Baptist Church” in some small town in Florida or West Virginia in the United States? 

To me, that’s a really interesting question. 

Maybe you’ll find another Cappadocian museum, something that will answer that question and help you make sense of this Christianity thing, or religious movements more generally? 

Maybe you’ll find something you never expected. 

Insha'Allah
