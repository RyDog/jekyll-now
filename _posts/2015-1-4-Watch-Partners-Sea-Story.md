title: Watch Partners (A Very Typical Sea Story)

"Yeahhhhhh...I'm really worried about this picture he sent me on the jeeeee mail. Just sittin' in that livin' room in that Lazy Boy in the middle of the day in Arizona with the blinds drawn like that. Man that ain't right. And he never sends me pictures you know? So of course I didn’t think much of it at the time, but now the more I think about it I just can’t get that image out of my mind - him sitting like that in the dark and wah wahhhmm wahhhh wahhhhwahhh...."

{{Jesus Christ is he talking about this f***ing picture his stepson sent him again? I cannot hear this again. I am not listening, I am not listening…}}

“...wahh wuuummm wahhh boy ought to be outside I mean it's 100 degrees and he's sittin in the apartment in the dark? 25 years old! Man I can't get this picture out of my head. The image of him just wahhhh a wahh wuhhh wahhhh..."

{{When did these watches become four hour unpaid therapy sessions? When did this become my job? Maybe if I don't say anything or even acknowledge that he's speaking he will start to understand that I don't want to listen to his life problems and anxieties? But I’ve been doing that for weeks and it’s not working. Man, I apologize to anyone that I've done this to. I know I've done this to people. Gonna write a letter. Just focus on the horizon. Focus on the horizon. His words are not entering your brain. Bouncing off…}}

"And now he wants to buy a .308! Five Hundred Bucks! He told his Mom that he needs it because the price of meat is so expensive in Arizona. You believe that? And that he’s going to kill an antelope with it and that she should think about how much money he's going to save on meat! Kid has never had a job! He doesn't know how to hunt and he lives in the middle of a big city. Kill an antelope! And she’s sending him my money. No way is he going to buy a rifle with the money I’m making out here. And Jesus, he's really gotten into all of this survivalist stuff, it really scares me. I told you about the bumper sticker on his car didn't i?"

{{“Yea, about TWENTY F***ING TIMES DUDE! Please, please stop talking to me. Please!}}

“Yeah, It says 'Your Worst Enemy Is Your Government'. You believe that? Oh man that is just crazy. And his Mom sends the money i make out here at sea to him...i mean I'm out here chasing damn twenty dollar bills around the deck out here and she's sending him my money. I think about that when I’m out on deck chipping rust and painting. I think about him with no job in Arizona just wahhhhwahhh wuhhh wahhh wahhhh... Wahhh…wahh...
You hear that Mate? 
Mate?"

'Huh?'

"You hear the part about the rifle?"

‘I did. I heard it yesterday as well.’

“Well what do you think about it? You’re a pretty young guy. What do you make of it?”

“You want to know what I think about all of it?'

'I would love to.'

'Well, I think the kid sounds like a shooter.'

"A shooter?"

'Yeah, a shooter. You know what I'm saying? Like one of those nuts that goes off and kills a bunch of people and leaves behind some incoherent manifesto or YouTube video about why he did it that makes no sense to anyone other than himself. I mean, let's be honest, if he went on a shooting spree in a supermarket in Phoenix and then died in a shootout with the cops, and then they found a manifesto sitting on his lazy boy that connected 9/11 to the price of meat would you be surprised? Or would everything suddenly make complete sense?'

"Jesus Mate. Uh...well I don't know. Man that's, um, well I dunno there Mate..."

[[[[Wow, you are a real a**hole sometimes, you know that?]]]]

{{ohhhhh! Look who decided to show up! You are really calling me an a**hole? I have been listening to this guy's thoughts - a stream of his pathetic thoughts - for almost two months now. 8 hours a day I've been listening to it! If he wants to keep treating me like his therapist I'm going to start telling him what I really think. And I think his kid is f***ed up. Kid sounds like an angry, delusional loser - the type of resentful extremist who would go do a shooting. That's what I really think. And I think his stepfather here is probably largely to blame. You think this guy was a good father? He was gone most of the kids life! And the kid had to listen to this same crap that I'm listening to. I'd be messed up too!}}

[[[[Why don't you try having a little compassion? What's wrong with you?]]]]

"wah wah wahhhhwahhh Well so anyways Mate, the old lady has a good one for me. Yeah, get this: Now she wants to go out to Seattle to see her daughter for a month when i get back home. So there goes $500 or a thousand bucks right there. That’s at least, at least 25 hours of overtime right there you know? I’m gonna have to go out there on deck and chase down at least 25 twenty-dollar bills just for that flight you know? Yeeeeeep. But at least she'll be staying with her daughter, though you know so wah wah wahhhhwahhh wah wump wump wahhh wahhhhh..."

{{dude, you are making me dumber. I swear to God I get dumber every day I listen to you ramble on about your boring life...}}

[[[[you are so judgmental, you know that? I'm embarrassed to share the same mind with you sometimes. This is a hardworking American. Salt of the earth. You act like we're better than him or something. We are not better than this man, so stop acting like we are.]]]]

{{You do not exist on the same level of consciousness as me! I am on the front lines with this big galoot, this simple-minded f***ing oaf, for 8 hours a day! You show up to sprinkle your morality and restraint on the situation whenever you feel like it, you dilettante. Do you know how much time I have spent with this lug in the past month? Over 200 hours! There are married couples who don't spend that much time one on one with each other in 6 months. And I don’t think we are ‘better’ than him - whatever that even means. Well, maybe I do, but that is irrelevant. I just don’t want to listen to him speak any more. I can’t listen to it. I can’t take it. I’m not strong enough. A hardened terrorist would crack after a month of having to listen to this. And by the way, it is affecting you, too. You just aren't aware of it yet. That's how this sh*t works. It creeps in. It gets below the surface eventually, amigo…}}

“wahwuumm wummmwahh wummm So I dunno, Mate I'm glad she's going to spend time with her daughter I guess. It's just the plane ticket and..."

'Wait, let me get this straight: you're gone to sea for 6 months, she is not working, does not have a job. So you send her the money you make out here working hard on a ship, and then she sends part of that to your stepson who is 25 and has never had a job in his life and who you never see. And he’s going to take some of that money and buy a rifle. And then as soon as you get back home after not seeing your wife for six months she's going to take a month-long vacation on your dime, without you?'

"Well, yeah Mate. I guess that's all true.”

'Well it sounds like you're being used. Being played for a real fool. Why do you put up with it?'

[[[[are you kidding me??? Why are you doing this to this poor guy? You should be trying to help him. This is just vicious. This is wanton cruelty. Really, you need to seek help. Something bad is happening to us out here. You've changed since we've been on this ship.]]]]

{{No sh*t Sherlock! I just told you that. This guy is driving US crazy. HE is doing this to me, and YOU are next!}}

[[[[ok, ok, well, I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but we should not take any chances. You’re right. Just go ahead and do whatever it takes to make it stop. But I don't want to know about it.]]]]

{{of course you don't...}}
