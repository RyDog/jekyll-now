I woke up this morning in the Rockies feeling great, but after a few handfuls of trail mix and some distilled water I decided to leave the life I had built near Nederland behind. 

I was wondering where I should go and I thought about the word Yellowstone, but I didn't really know where it was so I looked it up. Turns out it's in Wyoming. I packed up and pulled the Taurus out onto 72 and drove north through the Rockies, through Rocky Mountain National Park, and then down into the foothills. From Fort Collins I went north on 287 to Laramie, Wyoming. 

Stunning, dynamic country the whole way that kept me energized and excited for what I might see around the bend or over the next hill. When I got to Rock Springs, Wyoming it was 9 pm and I needed to turn north to go to Jackson, Wyoming. But first I had to make a little post about my day, because I'm disciplined like that....
