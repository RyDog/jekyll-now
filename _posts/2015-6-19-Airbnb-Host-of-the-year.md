Please meet Antonio, the man I would like to nominate for AirBnB Host of the Year. 

Last night, after delivering a 45 minute sermon on the greatness of the Greek people, and while smoking what was probably his 10th hash filled cigarette of the day, Antonio suddenly began to explain to me the very complicated story of how and why the CIA carried out the 9/11 attacks. 

Antonio's Australian friend Simon was joining us at the table. Simon met Antonio through AirBnB and they hit it off so well that Simon has moved in.

Simon backed up everything that Antonio was telling me. It turns out that Simon "knows the truth" because he is actually in possession of some highly sensitive information that he received from Senator Chuck Schumer of New York State. He met "Chuck" while negotiating a business deal with the Senator, a deal which he cannot talk about. 

Simon also could not reveal the 9/11 Intel, but instead insisted that I should trust him on it. Simon is very successful. He is living in a filthy â‚¬9/night flophouse, but he spends most of the day laying around in his underwear negotiating large shipments of oil and even diamonds with people on Skype. 

"OK, 6 million barrels it is!".

"Well, mate, because our team in Amsterdam buys the stones directly from the auction! We cut out all the middlemen!"

Right.

Simon calls me 'champ' as in 'how ya goin Champ?'. 

While trying to reason with these men, I made the mistake of drawing a comparison between 9/11 truther-inside-jobbers and holocaust deniers. 

Antonio calmly began to inform me that, actually, the Holocaust did not happen the way "The Jews" claim it did, either. In fact, it was the Jews who paid Hitler more than $2 billion in order to kill Jews in Europe. 

And so there was no Holocaust, but if there was it was done by the ultra rich Jews in order to get more money and to provide a basis for establishing the state of Israel where they could set up shop for good.

Simon was quiet on this one. But he asked a few questions between deep drags on his cigarette. I think Antonio has planted a seed. 

And then Antonio tied the whole thing together: the Jews who "control all of the money" orchestrated the Holocaust through Hitler, 9/11 through the CIA and Mossad, and now are trying to destroy Greece through the IMF, European Union, and their Banks. 

We had reached a natural stopping point. 

"Well, gentlemen, I think I'll retire for the evening." Antonio and Simon were both rolling another spliff.

When I woke up in this morning at 9 am I walked back into the kitchen and found Antonio asleep in his chair. It seems that at some point in the night he had Hashed Out. He was snoring, and seemed to be very much at peace.

Thank you AirBnB, really.
