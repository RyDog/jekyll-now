+Interviewer: When you write, do you have a reader in mind?

G.O.: “I don’t think about a reader when I am writing something – when I am in the act. But he may be there in the underside of my mind, in my subconscious. If he’s there he is probably an American man in his early thirties - about my age - married or about to be married, maybe he has a baby or two, maybe he will have one soon. He’s educated, probably at least a bachelor’s degree.

He probably just took on a big loan from a bank to finance a house or an apartment that he’s going to pay off over the next, say, 25 years. He has a car or a truck that cost around $25,000 which he washes weekly. Maybe he enjoys playing golf? Maybe he was an athlete in high school or college and still plays recreational sports with other former athletes his age. He’s probably into fishing or hunting or going out into nature and camping every once in a while. If he doesn’t actually do those things, he thinks about himself as the type of person who does those things. He watches football, drinks beer.

After the struggle and uncertainty and searching of his 20’s he finally found a professional niche and has a pretty well defined career path in front of him. He’s finally comfortable, finally starting to settle into a path, a very well worn path. And it feels pretty good. When he wants to, he can sort of space out and catch a glimpse of the long arc of his life over the next 40 or 50 years. Not that he wants to do that very often, but he can do that. 

But he still has fantasies, of course – we all do. Fantasies of traveling to exotic places and meeting exotic people. Fantasies of sexual encounters with beautiful and strange women. Maybe on some particularly maddening and frustrating day when the pressures of work and wife and family are all pushing him towards the edge, he just fantasizes about running away – just doing a walk off and stopping by the bank to withdraw his savings before hopping on a bus to Mexico and leaving everything behind. He wouldn’t do that of course, but he might fantasize about it. 

I like the idea of writing for that guy. The idea of living a life and telling stories that guy wants to read about on his iPhone when he’s sitting in traffic after a long day at work, or on his way to a long day of work. Giving him escape, letting him live a little bit of a fantasy through my writing.”

+Interviewer: Could it be that this imagined reader that you are writing for is really yourself? That you are writing for a person that you could have become or that you might become?

G.O.: “I think you could be on to something. There could be something to that, yes.”

+Interviewer: So that is the only person you think about when you think about a reader?

G.O.: “No. To be completely honest, there is another reader I think about sometimes. She is a fairly attractive woman. Not necessarily a knock out, but a good body, takes care of her self you know? Classy, sophisticated. And reading what I’m writing makes her want to have sex with me, even perhaps subconsciously. But preferably consciously. 

Interviewer: So you are writing to have sex with women?

No, no, no. I know how that sounds, but I do not mean that I write to sleep with women or that I want to sleep with a lot of women. Actually, I think it’s much more interesting to have the opportunity to have sexual relations with many women and to deny yourself the opportunities than to indulge. Indulging would not be interesting. There is deep spirituality in the denial of pleasure, and I am much more interested in spiritual experience than carnal experience at this time in my life. But that does not mean that I do not want to be desired sexually, especially through the power of my writing. 

Look, the vast majority of women will not “get” anything that I write. I know that because the vast majority of women I’ve met in my life have thought I was a complete weirdo or whatever based on my thoughts and the things I’ve communicated to them. Right? 

So I don’t know. Picture a guy out on a ship in the Mediterranean in a winter storm, and his ship is getting pounded, everything rolling around and he’s sitting in his stateroom looking out his port hole in front of his keyboard whacking away at an interview with himself where he’s writing about his desire that some reasonably attractive woman somewhere is going to read what he’s writing and want to go to bed with him. Ok? Now imagine that this actually happens, his fantasy. Right? This interview he writes gets out there into the world and a woman reads it and is like, “yeah, I want to do him. I have no idea what this guy looks like, but I want to do him. I am that woman.” 

Is that pure fantasy, or could that really happen? If it happened, is that woman going to be crazy? Good crazy or bad crazy? 

I don’t have the answers to these questions, but hopefully, one day I will. 

Interviewer: Ok, next question, …
