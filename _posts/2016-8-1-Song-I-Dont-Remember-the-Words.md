title: The Song I Don't Remember the Name Of
---
On a beach in southern Mexico, sky bursting with stars, the Bluesman sat on a rock, singing songs as we laid in the sand before him, looking up, passing joints and big bottles of beer.  

He told stories about his 2 years On The Road, and his flight back to England in 3 days, to a Job, to Horror. 

But tonight: Freedom. 

He played another, we clapped and then he told us the story of the song: 

driving through a downpour on a motorbike in Cambodia, finding shelter in some filthy hut, drying off and discovering his instrument, a gift from his gone grandfather, warped and ruined. 

An eruption, utter loneliness, tears flowing as he smashed the machine to splinters. 

But later, lots of wine and then a walk into a black field with the remains, building a fire and offering a sacrifice to the Gods. 

I don’t remember the words, or the name of the song. 

But I remember that there’s always something to be grateful for.
