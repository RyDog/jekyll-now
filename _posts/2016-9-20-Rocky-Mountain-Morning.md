I left Bentonville, Arkansas around 6pm, drove part ways up the west side of Missouri then barreled across KANSAS in the dark through the lightning and then slowly up up onto the high plains and then I seen Denver and them Rocky Mountains. 

12 hours of driving and I pulled the Taurus over here above Boulder, Colorado as the sun was rising and met some friendly people who gave me a good tip about where to camp tonight. they said I might see elk. but first I need to go find a dispensary. I hope they are open on Sunday....
