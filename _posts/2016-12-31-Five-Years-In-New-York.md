title: 5 Years in New York
---
*(A long, rambling, self-absorbed true story called “5 years in newyork”)*
Some say you have to do 5 years to become a real newyorker.  Some say 10.
I did 5 and change, but almost never made it at all.  
Out until 6am partying, I rose, barely, after 2 hours of sleep and left an anonymous girl behind in my $1000/night suite at the Hotel Benjamin.  I rushed across midtown and arrived at a large corporate law firm for a half day of interviews, somewhere between extremely intoxicated and painfully hungover.  This was my last shot at a law job in newyork. 
Afterwards I was certain that they knew I had been drunk, and that they hated me.


A few weeks later, they called me and offered me a job.  La Fortuna.


I Graduated, passed the Bar, spent a month hanging out and surfing in South America, then signed on to a container ship as 2nd Officer on a trip to Europe.  Calm, bright days in the middle of the Atlantic, a job and a new life waiting for me in newyork, I was feeling something close to happiness.  Pure optimism is beautiful.


Finding my first apartment, that newyork right of passage, was no easy task.  After a week we landed a 450 sq ft, 2 bedroom apartment on E 24th St between 2nd and 3rd Avenues in a neighborhood with a disputed name.  We went with “Gramercy,” but in truth, it was more like “Murray Hill.”  Our small bedrooms shared a wall, through which we shared the sounds of many intimate encounters.


In the wake of the financial crisis, the law firm was overstaffed, and there was little work for me to do.  I spent hours surfing the internet, including match.com, where I eventually landed a date with a beautiful, sophisticated woman from a very wealthy family.  I couldn’t figure out what she saw in me.  I couldn’t believe match.com actually worked.  


We went to parties at art galleries, dined at expensive restaurants (where I always had to pay), and attended several bizarre art parties in the homes of very rich people.  At one party, while a 60’ish couple dressed in all black explained how they had paid $75,000 for a can of spray paint along with the artists’ instructions on how to empty the can on the wall of their apartment, we snuck off and had sex in one of their many marble-lined bathrooms.  


Three weeks later she invited me to a wedding in North Carolina, a turning point.  I declined, but I wasn’t sure why, and that was the end.  Years later I would chalk it up to a fear of commitment, a fear of true intimacy.  She went with another guy, an Argentinian banker and semi-professional polo player.  6 months later they were married, and she was pregnant.  Twists and turns.  La Fortuna.


My law firm was paying me $14,000 / month to sit around doing nothing.  I went out drinking and/or dating almost every night of the week.  My friend and roommate had already quit his law firm job after 4 months, and with our free time we started thinking about an internet business we could start together. 


Our first idea was an online men’s magazine, which we named “girlslikestatus.com.”  The name was from a song lyric by our favorite band The Hold Steady: “Guys go for looks, girls go for status.”  Our initial focus was on the topic we were most personally interested in at the time: how to meet women in newyork.  


We wrote a few articles, and then my partner started working on a piece titled “How to meet girls at church.”  Sitting around our tiny apartment, looking for churches to visit on his laptop, he said, “you know, it’s actually really hard to find churches online.  There should be a service for that.”  Although I hadn’t been inside a church in ten years, I thought it was a brilliant idea.  


FaithStreet was born.  


Around that time I met M, a girl that I would date for almost a year, and then off and on for another 6 months.  It was a tumultous relationship, and through all of it, I adamantly refused to ever refer to her as my girlfriend.  And yet she stuck around.  Clearly, there was something wrong with both of us.  


She worked in set design and production for film and television, and was also a bartender.  We had tremendous physical chemistry, and I enjoyed hanging out with her.  She taught me about the importance of passion, something that I had never understood, and one of the most important lessons i’ve ever learned.  She helped me try to find my own passions, and and shared hers with me. 


At the end of our relationship - the real end - during a post-mortem, she taught me more about my insecurities, weaknesses, fears and shortcomings as a human being in one hour than I had learned up to that point in my life. Laying in my bed, her fear of losing me eliminated, she blew holes in me, and shined 10,000 watt spotlights into my blind spots.  The realization of how badly and carelessly I had treated her, combined with her words expressing her still unshakable belief in my potential as a person, gutted me and brought me to uncontrollable sobbing tears.  I had never cried so hard in my life.  I had never thought more highly of her.  I drove her home in the morning, and that was the end.  Driving away, I remember thinking that if I ever wrote a book I would dedicate it to “M, who taught me about passion, and compassion.”  


After 6 months of having almost zero work to do at the firm, I was suddenly given too much work to do.  The job of being a corporate lawyer began to consume me in the way that I most feared it would.  I would routinely work 14 hours per day and go weeks without a day off.  I had completely lost control of my own time, the only really valuable thing we have in this life.  


Arriving home after work at some late hour, I would smoke a joint, drink 3 beers and then go to sleep.  I’d get up 7 hours later and go back to the office.  The multi-hundred million dollar and sometimes multi-billion dollar deals we were working on were interesting to me, but my actual day-to-day tasks, essentially very high level and high stress secretarial work, was not.


Early one morning, still at work around 2 am, I stared out of the window of my 40th floor office, as a light snow was falling. Looking out, I could see other people, probably my age, still at work in their offices in nearby buildings.  Looking down, I saw taxis rolling slowly up 6th Avenue searching for passengers, and behind 6th Avenue, I could see the ice rink at Rockefeller Center.  I had made it...I guessed.  If I kept my head down, in 10 years I’d probably be a partner in a large law firm, or maybe working “in house” for a large company or investment firm.  


But I wasn’t feeling it.  After only 8 months of this grind, I was suffering emotionally.  I realized that I was simply not created to do this job, and I knew I couldn’t go on much longer.  I decided that I had two choices: Quit, or just hang around doing as little as possible until they fired me.  I chose the latter approach, and I just stopped working.


Whenever someone would ask me if I had “availability” I would say “No, I’m swamped!”  During my last 9 months at the firm I did almost as little work as I did the first 6.  What I actually worked on was FaithStreet, and we began to make a lot of progress, eventually launching our first version while I was still getting paid by the firm.  


When I walked into my last semi-annual review, I knew that they were going to fire me, or as they put it, “we believe it’s time you seek alternative employment opportunities.”  I got to keep my office and get paid for the next 3 1/2 months, while still doing no work.  There is something to be said for working in a big company.


Around that time I met N, a model.  A real model, and the most beautiful woman that I’d ever been with.  I loved going places with her.  Guys would stare at her and women would stare at me.  Nothing seems to make a man more attractive than when he has a beautiful woman by his side.  We went to parties where all of the other women were models.  One thing I learned from her is that If you want to fuck models, date one.  


One time after we hadn’t spoken for a while, she invited me over to an address in midtown. I showed up to a top floor penthouse with huge balconies in the east 40s that must have been worth at least $5 million.  She was sitting on a white couch in a cocktail dress drinking a very expensive bottle of wine.  She explained that a very, very rich man who owned most of the taxi medallions in newyork was trying to get her to live there, essentially as his mistress.  He was showering her with gifts, including several pairs of Christian Louboutin shoes, and a brand new iPhone which were sitting on a nearby table.  


We made love all over that apartment, and then again in the morning.  Afterwards, we left together, walking out into the newyork morning.  She didn’t take the gifts, and she turned down his offer.  I deeply respected her for that, because it was a very, very tempting offer.  Self respect in a woman is a very attractive quality.  


We dated for 6 months, and then off and on for a while, but I knew that I didn’t have a real connection with her, although she seemed to have a deep connection with me.  She taught me that being hot isn’t enough: an obvious lesson, perhaps, but one that you still have to learn through experience.  


By the time I left the firm we had moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, into a beautiful and huge three bedroom loft.  I began to work full time on FaithStreet along with my two partners.  We created a home office, and with a combination of blind ambition and naiveté, started working on building a company.  Almost everyone that we knew thought we were delusional, which we may have been.  But maybe that’s what it takes to build something that has never existed.  


The two years between leaving my firm and finally getting FaithStreet off the ground were difficult.  We put everything we had into making the company work, and every day was a learning experience.  Looking back, it’s easy to see that we were getting a very expensive and very valuable education in how to start a company, but at the time, there were many dark days filled with deep doubts.  For ambitious people, the fear that you might be wasting your time on something that will never work, especially something that everyone around you thought was stupid, is a very powerful fear.  Doing all of that while struggling financially is kind of crazy.


But we never gave up, and we eventually found an investor who believed in us, and who helped us launch the company for real. The things we did, and the people we prayed with in order to stay afloat could fill a book, and probably will.  It was pure hustle, pure perseverance, and straight-up toughness.  Looking back, it was also absurd and darkly humorous.  But all of that is probably true of every successful endeavor.  


We raised $1.2 million dollars, hired people, created a business model and began to build a sales process and attract customers.  We acquired the religion section of the Washington Post newspaper and integrated it into FaithStreet, and the company that we’d started on a white board in our tiny apartment on E24th Street over 3 years earlier had become a real thing.  In the process we had become entrepreneurs, and I finally knew what I wanted to be when I grew up.


Around this time I met S.  An actress and model, she had recently emigrated from Venezuela, although really she had escaped.  She was bartending at a Venezuelan restaurant near the FaithStreet office when I went in one day for lunch.  I was captivated.  She would later say that I stared at her the entire time, and that she was partly creeped out, and partly turned on.  I came back the next day, stared at her for an hour again, and then asked her out.  A few weeks later we went to brunch, and then rode bikes around Brooklyn.  She claims I told her my entire life story in the first ten minutes.  


I had never wanted a woman the way I wanted her.  She tried to push me away, refused to answer my texts and calls after that date, but eventually I wore her down.  Within 4 months we were living together.  I was terrified at being this close to someone, but it was also exhilarating.  At 31 years old, I had my first real girlfriend, and I was obsessed with her.  


By the beginning of 2014, after 8 months with S, I had been working on FaithStreet for nearly four years, and I was getting burned out.  As companies grow, people’s roles inevitably change, and I was unhappy with my role in the company, among other things.  The relationships between the cofounders had become strained, and we had disagreements about how to run the company.  The company was airborne, but it was going to be at least a 5 year commitment to see things through, and I couldn’t imagine myself making it.    


A nagging injury that began the year before had turned into a chronic pain issue, and my obsession with work left me unable to appropriately address it.  In the same way that I realized several years earlier that I could no longer be a lawyer, I began to realize that I could no longer continue to be a part of the company that I had helped create.  But there was no comparison with leaving law.  We had created this company from nothing, I had poured all of my money, my physical well being and my soul into it, and leaving was the most painful and confusing part of my life.  But it had to happen, and it was the best thing for me and for the company, which I still believe in completely.  


Afterwards, I was at the lowest point of my life.  I had very little money, no idea how I was going to make more money, and I was in a great deal of physical pain.  I was in a deep hole.  Four and a half years before I’d arrived in newyork full of optimism, and in what felt like the prime of my life.  Now I felt like I was as far away from that place as I could be.  It felt like the city had beaten the shit out of me.  


But S was there beside me, and she stood by me through those difficult days.  She took care of me for the next 6 months as I clawed my way out of the hole, first by finding consulting jobs for a few startups, and then by helping me begin the rehabilitation process to address my pain and injury.  We moved to a new apartment, our own studio in Bushwick, and we were creating a life together.  But over time, I had neglected our relationship, too focused on starting my next company, and I had taken her for granted.  I began to push her away, and then I decided that I needed to go on a spiritual journey, by myself, to figure out big spiritual questions that were weighing heavily on me.  We agreed that we needed the space, and I was looking forward to figuring out our future when I returned.


But when I returned, 5 weeks later, she had moved on.  By the time I realized how much she meant to me, how much I loved her, she was gone, and when I tried to get her back, I couldn’t.  The breakup brought out the worst in both of us, and I slowly realized that, sometimes, when you break something, you can’t put it back together.  And yet, if I ever write a book, I might dedicate it to “S, who believed in me when I doubted myself, and who saved me.”  Despite everything, she did save me, and I’m eternally grateful to her.  


At 32 years old I’d just gone through my first painful break up.  The emptiness I felt in my apartment without her was crushing, and I knew that I couldn’t live there.  Without her, I had no reason to be in newyork, and it was time for me to leave.  I put up an ad on craigslist and sublet the apartment.  My brother came up to help me move, and I packed my ’97 Subaru full of almost everything I owned, handed the keys to the apartment to a young Danish couple, and wished them the best.


With my brother passed out in the passenger seat beside me, in the early morning I drove out of the city in very light traffic, past views of the lower manhattan skyline from the Brooklyn side, and felt like I was slipping out of the city…just sneaking out.  


Memories of the previous 5 years raced through my mind.  The amazing experiences, the friends I’d made and lost, the women I had shared time with, the ambitious and brilliant people who had challenged me daily, the spiritual journey that I’d begun at my church in Greenpoint, the struggle, the pain, the drinking, the drugs, the concerts, the parties, and the feeling that there was nowhere else in the world where I could picture myself living.  Along with these memories, deep, unknown and confused emotions welled up and spiraled through me.  Tears rolled gently down my face, and I realized that I was really leaving.  I was skipping town.  If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you never know exactly how something is going to end…but end it will…


We drove straight through, 16 hours to my parent’s house on the Amelia River in Florida, and when I arrived I immediately passed out.  The next day I drove to Jacksonville, to the union hall where I had gotten my first job on a ship as a third mate after graduating from the Merchant Marine Academy.  I pulled into the parking lot in my dented and faded 97 Subaru and walked inside.  Sitting at a desk, smoking a cigarette and playing online poker, was the same woman who’d given me the first job on a ship 10 years before.  


“Hey, you look familiar,” she said.


“Yeah, I was in here 10 years ago and got my first job from you.”  


“Well, welcome back,” she said.


Full Circle.  


After working on ships, swearing I’d never work on another ship, traveling solo all over the world, going to law school, working in a big law firm, starting a company, having my heart broken, living in newyork for 5 years, and then leaving...here I was, right back in the same place I was 10 years before.


Full fucking circle.  Going back to sea.


But it feels right.  As Ishmael said in Moby Dick: 


“Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off - then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.” 


At sea, I’ll make good money and hopefully do some writing.  And when I return, perhaps I’ll do some more traveling, and then start my next company.  And maybe, just maybe I’ll find a good woman, and figure out how to be happy, too.  


But I won’t forget newyork.  I can’t.  That shit was crazy.
