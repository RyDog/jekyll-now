title: Little Rock to Bentonville
---
In Little Rock I stayed in an old firehouse that had been turned into a hostel slash firefighter museum. 
ten years ago the fire department upgraded to bigger fire engines and the new trucks could no longer fit inside the garage so it became a crack house for a while and then someone had the idea to turn the place into a firefighters museum and someone else had the idea to turn it into little rock's first travelers hostel. 
Over the course of ten years they merged those two ideas into one wild vision that eventually became a reality. 

when i arrived the place had just opened its doors and I was one of the first guests. 
one night I came back to the hostel after going out for a few brewskies and I offered the woman on duty at the front desk a few thoughts on how to improve the place. 
Suggestion number one was to remove the giant picture of the second plane exploding into the World Trade Center from the lobby. 
"I don't think it's the first thing a visitor to the hostel should see when they walk inside," I said. 

"But it's the worst disaster for firefighters in American history," she replied. 

"But you have a picture a horrific mass murder, a picture of people being incinerated on the wall directly opposite the entrance to your hostel," I replied.

She didn't want to talk to me after that. The museum and the hostel concepts are obviously still in tension. 

When I left town I got on i40 and headed West, eventually exiting around Atkins, Arkansas to take 105 up into the Ozarks. 
I drove along winding roads, into the hills of the Ozark National Forest. I stopped at "Cindy's" in Witt Springs to eat. Witt Springs had a large sign announcing that the annual "Hillbilly Daze" festival would be held in May, and inside Cindy's i noticed that she was selling Hillbilly Daze coffee mugs. 
I found Cindy in the back of the store in a small kitchen. she wearing a blue Hillbilly Daze shirt from the 2014 festival. 

I asked Cindy if she had a menu and she said no, she was only serving one thing, hamburger soup with bread and it was 5 dollars. 
I was very hungry and had not seen a restaurant in an hour. 
While I waited I looked at the other customers sitting at the 3 or 4 other round tables. 
they were all men in dirty overalls or jeans, most wearing dirty ball caps, all eating or having recently eaten hamburger soup and they were talking about the weather and machinery, pumps, trucks and animals. 
They ignored me. 

Outside, Cindy had two antique gas pumps, which I assumed were inoperative. 
but soon four men on motorcycles pulled up and one started filling his tank. 
When he finished he came inside and stood around by the cash register, fidgeting and looking around for someone to pay. 

Eventually one of the men at the tables yelled for Cindy and she told the man to hold on. 
She brought me my soup with a piece of garlic bread on the side. it was delicious, but when I finished i was still hungry. 
She asked the biker, "how much did ya get?" 

"two point two gallons," he said. 

Cindy pulled out a calculator, punched a few buttons and said "six dollars." 

I don't know how the math worked out that way, but he paid her six dollars and then the bikers all drove off. 

Later in the day I entered Harrison, Arkansas and was greeted by a large roadside billboard that said "Welcome to Harrison" and then underneath, in 5 thousand point font was the message:

"DIVERSITY IS A CODE WORD FOR WHITE GENOCIDE"

Huh? I turned around and drove back to a parking lot near the sign and got out to take pictures. 
Some welcome! I did a bit of research and learned that the KKK had set up shop in Harrison, which already had a shameful 20th century history of being a "sundown" town, a place where only white people were allowed to live. 

I drove on and then stopped at the Harrison Walmart to do some sightseeing. 

Driving out of Harrison, on the other side of town, I saw another billboard that read:

"Diversity is a Code for for Salvation."

Salvation. I was struck by that beautiful, extreme, religious response to the message of hate and intolerance, written in the language of Jesus Christ.

The people of Harrison had partially redeemed themselves, maybe they could be saved as well.

That night I arrived in Eureka Springs in the northwest corner of Arkansas in the rain. 
I pulled into a campground and paid 18 dollars for a primitive camping spot. 
It rained and rained. At dusk the rain let up and I got out of my car to set up my tent.

Then I drove to a nearby store and bought a bag of popcorn a two 22 oz Budweisers. On the way back to the campground it began to rain again. 
I climbed into the tent with my beers and a light and laid down on my thin air mattress. I put my headphones in and began listening to a Joseph Cambell lecture from the 1960's, "Mythology and the Individual." 
The rain drummed on the tent, I sipped my beers, it got darker, and darker...

In the morning I showered and packed up the tent. 
I got on the road and drove down from the mountains and into Bentonville, Arkansas, birthplace of Walmart. 
The Waltons, the billionaire Walmart $$$ family, took a few billion and built a museum of american Art in Bentonville that is becoming pretty famous. 
It's called Crystal Bridges, and admission is free, courtesy of WALLYWORLD...

Ya'll get down to Bentonville and check it out ya hear! 
It's beautiful...really...
