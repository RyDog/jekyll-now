title: Free Tour of Graceland
---
From Jackson I drove north to Memphis.  I stayed at a hostel run by the First Congregational Church in the Cooper-Young neighborhood. The people were nice and a dorm bed was $27 per night.  They want everyone to do chores each day, but I forgot.  The thing I really wanted to do was visit Graceland, but I was surprised to find out that an adult ticket for a tour of Elvis’ house ran to $38.75, which was much more than I wanted to pay.  

Fortunately, I met a local at the hostel who told me about the early-morning free-admission walk up visits to Elvis’ grave at Graceland.  From 7:30 a.m. – 8:30 a.m anyone can park right in front of Graceland and walk through the front gates of the Graceland property and up to Elvis’ mediation garden beside the mansion.  This is where the graves of Elvis and other members of his family are located.  

I arrived around 8 am, walked up to the garden and when I arrived at the grave site there were only 3 other people.  One was Ann from Norway. She's loved Elvis from the beginning and finally made her pilgrimage to Graceland. She was spending a week in Memphis, staying down the road at the "Heartbreak Hotel" getting up early to visit the every morning.  On the previous Sunday Ann placed a white porcelain angel  on the grave that she brought with her from Norway. She pointed it out to me and was very proud that the angel was still there.

On the other side of the garden was Elvis' swimming pool. In front of the pool I spoke with a woman who volunteers at Graceland. Her job is to keep people from disrespecting the graves. I asked her if she feels Elvis' spirit while she's here. She said, Oh Yes, of course. She said that he reveals himself all the time.  She sees feathers floating through the air above the meditation garden, pecans falling from a pecan tree onto the ground near her, and once the tail of the automated pool cleaner lifted out of the water and whipped water at her. 

She said that she never knows when it will happen, but when it happens, she knows...
