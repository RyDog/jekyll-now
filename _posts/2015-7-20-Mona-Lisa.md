There it is, the most famous smile in human history. But is it a smile?

Leonardo isn't telling...his lips are sealed!

Oh, badaboom...

And would you look at that crush of interest in the Old Girl. Hundreds of people jockeying to get the shot. Hey it's blurry and there's weird reflections coming off the glass but goddamnit they want to bag some big game!

They didn't come all the way to Paris to go home empty handed. Trophyless.

And they don't just want a pic OF her they want a pic WITH the old dame. Get outta my fahkin way I'm trying selfie with Mona! Ow, you hit me with your elbow. Shut up! Mona look this way! Over here! 

But we don't what Mona is looking at.

Oh, the poor museum staff. They are helpless. Probably gave up the fight around '94. Just trying to keep people from stealing paintings at this point. 

Down in front it's a Metallica concert. Mosh pit. Ppl are fighting each other. The gate in front of the stage is just rope, but every minute a few people tap out...they made it to the front and got the shots but now they're trapped. 

"Help meee!," says a young American girl. "Come on, come on, Allons-y!," says the security man as he lifts the rope. Three sweaty Japanese girls sneak in behind her and all four exit stage right. 

What's this? A cute blonde has decided she is not fighting her way to the front. Time to mount her boyfriend's shoulders. Yep, in the Louvre. 

Fuck it.

My God what is that noise? Is he, is he, no...blowing a whistle? Oh yeah, he's blowing a big whistle. And he is furiously waving a long stick with a green thing on the end that symbolizes God knows what. 

"Where are my 50 Chinese tourists on this badass package tour? Get your asses over here," he says in Mandarin. 

"No, not yet! 1 more selfie!," they reply.

It's 2015, folks.

Liberté, égalité, selfié!

Bonjour!
