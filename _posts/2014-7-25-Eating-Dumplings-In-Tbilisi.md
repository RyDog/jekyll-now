I did not sleep well. The springs of the thin mattress digging into my body woke me up several times during the night. “How many hundreds of people have slept in this bed?”, I wondered at some point.

There was no A.C. in the hostel, and the room was hot. One weak fan could not keep all 10 beds cool, and each time I awoke I was sweating.

Around 9am I opened my eyes. I felt hungover, which didn't make sense. 

How many drinks did I have last night?

I began counting: 1. 2. 3. Something like that. Feels like 15.

It must be the heat, I thought. Once I start moving around I will be fine.

I slowly got out of the bed and began to get dressed, putting my pants on one leg at a time.

My plan was to travel to Gori, 1.5 hours away via bus, to see the Joseph Stalin museum and childhood home. The hostel manager provided me with very clear instructions on how to get there, and at 10am I walked out of the hostel and into a very warm and muggy Tbilisi morning.

If things went as planned, I would get to Gori by noon, spend a couple of hours there, and then be back in Tbilisi by 3 or 4 to visit a museum.

Walking downhill from the hostel towards Freedom Square, I began to feel weaker and slightly nauseous. F**k. This isn't right. I'm feeling worse. Could I be feeling those dumplings?

The night before, a little after midnight, I stopped at a restaurant on my way back to the hostel and ate a steaming plate of authentic Georgian dumplings, washing them down with a large mug of Georgian beer. The staff were very friendly to me.

I can still picture the cook, a 60’ish Georgian woman, dressed in a very traditional style, wearing a headscarf and smiling at me through a small opening between the kitchen and the dining area. I gave her the 'thumbs up,' and smiled back. Mmmmmm! Good job on these dumplings!

Ah yes, I was beginning to feel right at home in Georgia last night. Really living like a local. A dumpling-eating machine.

By the time I reached Freeedom Square I could feel sweat running down my face, stomach, and legs. I was out of breath, and definitely nauseous. Eyeing a bench, I headed over and took a seat. Slumped forward on the bench, sweat pouring off of my forehead, I was sure that I did not feel well enough to sit on a bus for two hours. Time for an audible, I thought. Eventually I found the strength and motivation to pull out my pocket map of Tbilisi. 

I realized that the Georgian National Museum, which I had planned to explore after I returned from Gori, was just a short walk away from me. I decided that I would go to the museum first, and then once I started feeling better I would go to the bus station and find my way to Gori. 

I rested on the bench for a few more minutes, and then shuffled to the museum. 

The first exhibit I saw in the museum was in the lobby, before a ticket was required. An amazing and tremendously important collection of early Homo fossils - 1.8 million years old - all found in a cave in Dmanisi, just a couple of hours south of the museum. Cave men. Evolution. Heavy stuff. 

And then, while staring at the skull of a caveman, I noticed that the low hum in my stomach had turned into a rumble, and then suddenly...into a boil.

Panic. Bathroom. Where?

Trying to conceal the crisis that was engulfing me, I calmly walked across the lobby, smiling at the stylishly dressed women sitting behind the ticket counter, and then casually pushed open the door to the men's bathroom.

As the door began to close behind me, I quickly surveyed the scene: 1 stall. I'm alone in here. It’s on. Covering the seat with toilet paper was obviously not going to happen. 

I kicked open the stall, pulled my jeans and underwear down as if they were one piece of clothing, simultaneously turned my body around 180 degrees and launched myself towards the toilet. The carnage began midair, before I landed.

30 minutes later, I was still sitting there. A small, cloudy pool of sweat had formed on the floor in front of the toilet, and, with my forearms resting on my bare thighs, head facing down, I was staring at the pool. It was now obvoius to me that I was suffering from a serious case of food poisoning. The important question in my mind was, “how much worse is this going to get?” 

Slumped forward, girding myself for another intestinal spasm, I saw the face of that woman, smiling at me from the kitchen: the smile of death. She did this on purpose, I was sure. I mutter the word "dumplings," to myself and it takes on a new, very literal meaning: "Dump-ling."

The physiological symptoms of food poisoning are well known: nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, fever, dizziness, lightheadedness, blurry vision, muscle weakness and tingling. The symptoms are very unpleasant, especially when they are working together....working against you.

But the emotional symptoms of food poisoning, especially when struck by the illness several thousands of miles away from your home and nearest acquaintance, can be equally unpleasant. Those symptoms include a general feeling of emptiness, despair, regret, and possibly, an intense fear of dying alone in the bathroom of a museum in Tbilisi. The cause of death: having shat out some very important part of your anatomy. 

After 45 minutes or an hour in the bathroom, I felt like I had been wrestling with physical demons. I was spiritually and physically empty and exhausted, but the storm had momentarily subsided. I did not really want to leave the bathroom; in fact, I wanted to lay down on the floor and try to sleep. But I decided to try to find a taxi to take me back to my uncomfortable bed in the hostel. 

Emerging from the lobby bathroom of the Georgian National Museum, an hour after I entered, I walk past the museum ticket counter and towards the exit. I feel the judgement of the stylishly dressed women at the counter, and I imagine their thoughts: “F***ing Gringos…they never can handle their dumplings!” 

Outside, the midday heat throws a punch at my face and immediately connects. The force causes me to begin to feel like I'm going to lose consciousness. Am I conscious?, I wonder. Leaning against the building, part of my brain is telling me to hail a taxi and go back to the hostel, but another part of my brain says I'm too weak to do even that.

Detecting the outline of a pair of benches nearby, I stagger towards them and lie down on one. I find that it is almost long enough for me to stretch my legs out, but not quite. Lying on the bench, on a busy street in Tbilisi, Georgia around noon, I begin to drift asleep. It's very hot outside, and I notice that my entire body is sweating, and yet I also feel cold. I am shivering.

With my eyes closed, somewhere between consciousness and unconsciousness, a feeling of paranoia begins to set in. How bad could this get? Is one of the stylishly dressed ladies going to find me out here, deceased, on her way home tonight? Am I going to poop myself on this bench? I should go to the hospital, but how do I get there?

Laying helpless on this bench on a sweltering day, and entering a poisoned dream state, I begin to have a flashback. I've been here before. Maybe I am there.

I'm in Youngshou, China and I've just spent all day riding a bicycle through the countryside, going back in time. Rice patties and earthen shacks and people with black teeth in pointy Chinese sombreros. Back in the town and exhausted after riding perhaps 30 or 40 miles, I stop at a restaurant on the river. I eat “beer fish,” the local dish, and then entertain a kid wearing a Kobe Bryant jersey who wants to practice his English on me.

I return the bike, and then 10 minutes later, while walking down a crowded, commercial pedestrian street, I am struck by debilitating cramps in my abdomen. I've never felt stabbing pain like his before, and it scares me. I stop in the middle of the street as people, a mix of local Chinese and Western tourists, pass by all around me. But I can't move. 

The cramps are pulling me to lean forward, but my sphincter muscle is spasming, threatening to open up completely with the slightest forward bend. Motherf***ing beer fish. How stupid am I? I see the toothless smile of the Chinese grillmaster...mocking me.

I stand in the street, paralyzed for several minutes, and unable move. Eventually, the stomach cramps overwhelm me, and leaning forward, I feel warm, wet poo running down my leg and onto my feet and flipflops. Quickly, the smell confronts me, and then I realize that I'm standing in the middle of a street in western China, and I'm crapping my board shorts.

Between two market stalls, I see a vacant lot, and behind the lot an alley. I begin walking quickly towards the lot, weaving between the crowds of people, and uncontrollably shitting myself with every step. Along the way it occurs to me that for the first time in my adult life, I've completely lost control of my bowels. 

In the lot I find a stone wall, and I sit down. I'm sweating heavily, and leaning forward, with no idea what my next steps should be, I feel myself pooping again, and feel the foul substance bubbling up over the back of my board shorts and onto the stone wall behind me. Flys begin to buzz around me, and a steady trickle of people emerge from the alley. 

As these people walk past me, I notice that some recognize that I am a man in distress. They stop, stare, and perhaps think about walking towards me, but they all quickly realize that "this guy is covered in sh*t," and move along. Staring at the ground, covered in my own excrement, helpless and un-helpable, I am a monster. A big poo-covered, food-poisoned Gringo monster. 

Nothing in my life had prepared me for this moment, for this crisis. I'm in so much pain that I lay down on the wall, too weak to move. On the wall, writhing, trying to hide my face, a Waylon Jennings song begins to play in my mind..."I'm a long way from home and so all alone"....

My dream state begins to veer back towards the present, and I remember that I'm not on a wall in China, but on a bench in Tbilisi. I have passed several hours on this bench. 

Around my brain is a prickly fog, preventing clear thoughts from forming, and in the background a light hammering breaks the focus of any ill formed thoughts that manage to break through. Sweat is running down my face in little rivers, but when I place the back of my hand on my forehead it feels very cold. Spasms that begin in my stomach pulse slowly through my body in both directions, towards my brain and towards my feet. When this happens, my whole body feels like a leg that has “fallen asleep.” Dumplings…

Remembering my dream, I begin trying to figure out whether or not I have soiled myself on this bench, and decide that I have not. Summoning new strength gained while asleep, I stand up and hail a taxi. Within 10 minutes I’m standing in front of my hostel. 

Climbing the stairs, I feel the poison beginning to circulate in my stomach again, and the first spasm strikes. I must find the toilet, I realize. The bathroom is adjacent to the communal kitchen, where I see 3 young German guys drinking beer and playing cards. 

A thin wall separates the two rooms. Sensing (correctly) a repeat of the incident at the museum, I quickly make my way towards the bathroom. I know that seconds are precious in this situation, but I pass the kitchen very calmly, hiding my pain and panic, and casually wave and smile to the Germans. Nothing to see here, gentlemen. 

I gently close and lock the door, tear my pants and underwear down, and then jump towards the toilet. I land on the seat with force, and immediately unleash torrents of foul spray that are accompanied by very loud, bass-heavy sounds. Wave after wave after loud wave.

From the kitchen, I hear a collective inhale that is followed by a deep, collective German belly-laugh. This laugh is quickly muffled, only to be periodically unleashed again. Humiliation.

In agony, I imagine the scene in the kitchen: the Germans are probably rolling around on the floor, tears streaming down their faces, trying not to look at each other. It is one of the funniest scenes they can ever recall. They hear every sound.

Sitting on the toilet, I understand completely. If I were in the kitchen I would also think this was very funny. I would think it was funnier than they think it is, and I would probably have to go outside to gain control of myself. But I’m not in the kitchen...

After 45 minutes, I stand up from the toilet and turn on the shower. There is no papering over the mess that I have made here. In the shower, I struggle to stand upright, and then I vomit. Kneeling in the shower, with the water running over my back, I watch the vomit disintegrate and disappear down the drain. 

I’m completely empty, and completely exhausted. After drying myself with my dirty shirt, I shuffle back past the Germans, who avoid eye contact with me. Entering the doom room, I collapse on my mattress in my underwear, and then writhe in pain, trying to position myself in such a way that the stomach cramps will relax. I hear them trying, unsuccessfully, not to laugh.

In the bed...sweating, shivering, writhing, cramping, and worried about the very real possibility of soiling myself in the bed, I begin to drift off…

Amidst the fog, in a poisoned dream, I hear Waylon Jennings’ voice. He’s singing:

“I'm a long way from home and so all alone
Homesick like I never thought I'd be
I'm a long way from home, everything is wrong
Someone please watch over me.”
