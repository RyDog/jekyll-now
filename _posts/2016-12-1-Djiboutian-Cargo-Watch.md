salt water fumes and diesel fuel vapors  
painted steel decks, rusting through  
greasy wires, catching your arm    
tractors and trucks and lifts and cranes  
ladders, lashers, lashings and locks  
moving the boxes, stacking the boxes  
empties, twenties, forties and tanks  
lifting the hatches, lower the hatches  
banging, clanging, dropping and smashing.
walking the deck, checking the times  
noise and exhaust  
radio sounds  
Roger and Aye  
these ports all look the same:  
these watches are all the same:  
same same but different.  

A visitor:

Gangway Watch:
"Hello. Hello! Please state your business."

Man:
"I am vessel agent. Please I must to see Chief Officer."

Gangway Watch:
[*aggressively*} "Let's see yur badge, come on show it to me!"

Man:
"My Badge, here"

[*hands badge to Gangway Watch*]

Gangway Watch:
[*reads badge* then speaks to Mate on Watch]:

“Hey look, this guy’s name is Muhammad Ali!”

“Hey Muhammad, you’re the greatest, huh?”

[*throws right hook that lands in the air very close to Muhammad’s face; begins to laugh, almost maniacally*]

Mate on Watch:
[*sweating; greasy; not amused*]

Man:
[*laughs nervously; take small step backwards*]

Mate on Watch:
“Come on, I’ll take you to the Cargo Office.

{As they walk away, in background, booming, self-satisfied laughter of GW continues}

{In Ships Cargo Office}

Mate on Watch:
“Mate, this is the ship’s agent, he’s here to see you.”

Chief Officer:
[sitting at ballast control station]
“Be with you in a minute.”
[*does not look up from his work of shifting water between the ship’s ballast tanks*]

Man:
[*begins to look around the office. Sees photograph of four children stuck between rows of keys on a computer keyboard on desk. Picks up the photograph and brings it close to his face. A look of fascination and infatuation appears along with wide smile*]

“Ahhh, these are your family?”

Chief Officer:
“Uhhh…”

[*swivels, then rises from chair and reaches for the picture, grabs picture from man’s hands then places it in his own pocket*]

Man:
“Your daughter is very beautiful!”

“I want to marry her!”

Chief Officer:
[*looks at Mate on Watch*]

{for 2.5 seconds the Chief Officer and the Mate on watch look at each other in silence}

Mate on Watch:
[to Chief Officer]: “Maybe that’s a compliment?”

Chief Officer:
[*takes step towards Man and then glares at him*]

“My daughter is seven years old.”

Man:
“Yes, I will wait!”

“She is so beautiful!”

{3 seconds of silence during which the Man continues to smile broadly, exposing his long, yellowed and red veined teeth}

Chief Officer:
“No. No, you will never marry my daughter.”

“You will never marry her. Do you understand?”

Man:
[*through smiles*] 
“Why? Because I am African? Because I am black skin?”

Chief Officer:
“Yes, because you are an African with black skin. And because you are probably 45 years old and my daughter is SEVEN, which is disgusting. And because I don’t like you.”

“We are not going to talk about my daughter again, ok? I don’t want you to think about my daughter. Why are you in my office? What do you want?”

Man:
“Ok, no problem sir! No problem, I will not ask again about your beautiful daughter. We talk later."

"She must have beautiful mother!”

Mate on Watch:
“Easssyyyyy..”
