title: 3 Months In Mexico
---
My eyes are closed.  I’m lying on a familiar bed in a familiar dark room thinking about writing, the ceiling fan whirring above.  I want to write about Mexico, from where I have recently departed, and for three days I’ve been searching my memory for an image that will allow me to begin, an image I can use to start the process of turning my story of three months South of the Wall into organized words on a screen.  


Drifting off, in the in-between, a man appears, soft focused and distant, standing alone on a beach in the shallows, shirtless and barefoot.  The image slowly becomes clearer, colors begin to emerge from the black and white, and as I move towards the figure I see him cup his hands together and bend down, scooping into the water, standing back up and staring into the bowl.  He watches the water quickly run out through the cracks between his fingers and hands, feels the water running down his forearms to his elbows where the trails drip and fall in back into the sea.  


Closer still, more colors emerge and the focus is perfectly real as I watch him bend down and scoop again into the surf, which surges above his knees to the mid thigh and then falls again to his ankles.  His face tenses as he squeezes his fingers and hands together, fighting to prevent the leaking of the foamy water.  The small surf rolls rhythmically around him, up and down the playa, rising and falling, as the water, more slowly this time, runs through his fingers, down his arms, and back into sea.  


He opens his empty hands and stares at his palms, notices grains of black sand contrasted against his reddish white skin, and rubs them together before wiping his hands on the sides of his faded blue cotton shorts.  Standing fully erect the man faces the sun, which hangs low, red and perfectly round, low and dull enough to stare at for a moment, as it slowly falls towards the clear, cloudless Pacific horizon.  


He extends and raises his arms high, palms out, and releasing his neck his face falls backwards, eyes pointing straight up at a massive swirling mural of oranges and pinks against dark blue painted by an unknowable master.  A light, warm sea breeze blows across my wet body, sending slight chills across my skin, as a stare up at the mural in wonder.  I stand in that image, feet sinking into the sand and time does not exist.  I know that I will be there forever, arms raised, certain in my faith that I am  free, as free as I will ever be.
